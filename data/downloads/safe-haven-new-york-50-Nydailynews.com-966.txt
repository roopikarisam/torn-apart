"Dear Mighty, Longtime reader. We know Mighty is a big supporter of law enforcement and frequent flyer on the LIRR! Please give a special shout out to the 700 brave men and women of the MTA Police Department, established January 1, 1998, celebrating 20 years of protecting and serving commuters on the Long Island Rail Road, Metro North and Staten Island Rapid Transit.

"The MTAPD protects the biggest and busiest transportation facilities in the world! From Montauk to Manhattan, New Dorp to New Haven, and everywhere in between! Protection through dedication! God bless and stay safe MTA's Finest! All the best lad, Ryan Doherty."

"Hey, Mighty. Tommy Henry, president of the MQFC, The Kerry Hills, Rockaway Beach Chapter. The Lovely Marianne's (aka wifey) birthday is Jan. 10th. Please wish her a happy birthday in your column."

Mighty was waiting on North Carolina (-14) on Tuesday and likes Villanova (-9) on Wednesday. The deficit is 230 sirignanos.
