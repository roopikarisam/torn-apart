For a peek at how exciting the downtown condominium scene is becoming this new year, take a look at an upscale design for 44 units scheduled to break ground this spring at 17th and Central in LoHi – within three blocks of a dozen indoor/outdoor dining venues including Ale House, Avanti, Linger, Lola, The Bindery and Marcella’s.

Kentwood City Properties agents Molly Weiss, Jan Nelsen and Christine Nicholson will show you how appealing that could be at a preview event today for GrandView LoHi, noon-to-2 p.m. at Candela Latin Kitchen – with mimosas and breakfast burritos, in a setting that’d be just across 17th Street when Grandview opens in 2019.

“This is the only new for-sale condo project in the Highlands that will be easily walkable to Downtown and Union Station,” says Churchill Bunn, who’s teamed with veteran developer Steve Robbins on the project, after similar ventures in Golden Triangle, Cherry Creek and Boulder.

Like those adjacent dining spots, GrandView will make the most of an unobstructed view across Central Avenue to downtown’s skyline. The LoHi Pedestrian Footbridge, carrying walkers and bikers into Riverfront, Union Station, and Coors Field, is a block south.

Developers are talking with a small-format grocer about some of the 5,000 square feet of street-level retail that GrandView will offer along Central, which developers believe will be a great amenity.

“We’re seeing this as a small community where neighbors will know each other,” says Molly Weiss. Agents will show you a range of plans starting with a few one-bedrooms priced now from only $379,000 (no dedicated parking with those), to a choice of larger one-bedrooms from the high $300s; and two-bedrooms from the $500s to $700s, all with dedicated covered parking included.

Or you could maximize the view from one of several two-level penthouses – one-to-three bedrooms clustered around a 17-foot-high great room, each with a private rooftop terrace (they’re from $699,000). All homes, even the least expensive, include a glass-enclosed balcony.

Jan Nelsen notes that the introductory pricing is low enough that they will be accessible to millennial buyers that have been shut out of the for-sale market around downtown. But Bunn adds that the best units will go early, and once construction begins, so will the opportunity to customize a unit with upgrades.

To reach the event at Candela, from noon to 2 on Sunday, Jan. 21, from downtown take 15th Street northwest into LoHi, then turn right on Central, two blocks.
