A taxi driver from New York City was stopped in Fort Lee by narcotics officers from the Bergen County Prosecutor's Office with 10 pounds of suspected crystal meth and 4 grams of cocaine, Acting Bergen County Prosecutor Dennis Calo said Monday.

Gerardo Camilo-Nolasco, 42, of the Bronx, was the lone occupant of a vehicle that belonged to a friend of his when he was stopped and arrested Friday morning. The stop was the culmination of a narcotics investigation, authorities said. 

A search of the vehicle revealed the drugs. The crystal meth has a street value of about $800,000, according to the prosecutor's press release. 

Nolasco was charged with first degree possession with the intent to distribute greater than 5 ounces and third degree possession of cocaine.

He is being held in the Bergen County Jail while he awaits a first appearance at Central Judicial Processing Court in Hackensack.
