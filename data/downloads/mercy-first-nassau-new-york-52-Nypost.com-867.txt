An Iowa teen who allegedly stabbed his ex-girlfriend to death wanted her to “feel the pain he was feeling” after their breakup, according to authorities.

Tran Walker, 18, told police that he stabbed his 17-year-old ex-girlfriend numerous times Sunday over frustration that she wouldn’t get back together with him, the Sioux City Journal reported.

Walker, of Sioux City, is accused of killing his ex, Paiten Sullivan, and an 18-year-old friend who tried to intervene, authorities said.

Police said Walker became upset with Sullivan while in a car early Sunday morning with their mutual friend, Felipe Negron Jr., and attacked them.

Sullivan and Negron were rushed to Mercy Medical Center-Sioux City, where they were pronounced dead, police said.

The 18-year-old suspect was arrested around 2 a.m. at a local grocery store where he showed up injured, according to the Sioux City Journal.

Walker reportedly confessed to the fatal stabbings in an interview with police.

He was booked at Woodbury County Jail, where he is being held on first-degree murder charges.
