A former preschool teacher was arrested after he allegedly sexually abused children while they napped.

Jayrico Jayrice Hamilton, 25, was arrested Tuesday, months after the parents of two boys who were once in his care filed lawsuits against Hamilton and Orlando's Bright Horizons Children's Centers, where he worked.

Hamilton was fired in May, and the day care center is on probation per settlement terms reached with The Department of Children and Families in October, the Orlando Sentinel reported.

Hamilton was first interviewed on May 17, after a 4-year-old boy told his parents that the caretaker sexually abused him, an arrest affidavit shows, the Orlando Sentinel reports.

Hamilton denied the accusation and was not arrested.

Investigators also interviewed the boy, who denied having told his parents that he was molested.

A second boy, age 3, also told an adult that Hamilton touched his penis, the Orlando Sentinel reported.

But the child "was not able to provide consistent details as to this contact" in a forensic interview, the arrest report states.

Investigators could not confirm that the child had been sexually abused, the detective wrote in the report.

The first boy — now five-years-old — was interviewed again in January after attending therapy sessions to talk about abuse.

He told investigators Hamilton put his mouth on his penis "kind of every day" during nap times, according to the report. The child also said Hamilton touched and kissed him on the mouth, the arrest report states, the Orlando Sentinel reported.

Witnesses said Hamilton favored one boy and would read to a child while he lied on Hamilton's chest.

Hamilton, who now works as an insurance representative, was arrested in Winter Park Tuesday.

He is being held in the Orange County Jail without bond.

He faces charges of capital sexual battery, child abuse and lewd conduct and molestation.
