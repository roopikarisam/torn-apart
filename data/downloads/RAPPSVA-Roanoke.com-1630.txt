A King George County man has been arrested in connection with a fatal accident Wednesday night in King George in which a motorcyclist was killed.


The accident occurred at 9:39 p.m. on State Route 3 near Index Lane. State police Sgt. Keeli Hill said a 2005 Honda motorcycle driven by 41-year-old Steven Lynn Williams of Alexandria was heading east on Route 3 when a westbound 2017 Honda Accord turned onto Index Lane in the path of the motorcycle.


Williams collided with the passenger's side of the Honda and was thrown from the motorcycle. He died at the scene.


A woman who lives in that area posted on social media that she and her husband heard the crash and immediately administered CPR to the victim, to no avail.


Meanwhile, police said, the Honda driver got out of his vehicle and fled on foot. James Norman Rouse, 48, was apprehended at 2:16 a.m. Thursday following a search that included King George Sheriff's Office personnel, police dogs and others.


Rouse was charged with felony hit and run and placed in the Rappahannock Regional Jail. Hill said that other charges are pending.
