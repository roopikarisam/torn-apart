Lonzo Ball fortunately has his Lakers brothers to support him in the face of his boastful dad.

Second-year forward Brandon Ingram stood up for Ball on Tuesday after the Wizards’ Marcin Gortat mocked the rookie on behalf of his father LaVar’s pregame prediction. The Lakers play host to the Wizards in a suddenly tense matchup Wednesday evening.

“Yeah, of course we did,” Ingram said about Gortat’s tweet on Monday, according to ESPN, that joked Wizards teammate John Wall “will torture” Ball at the point guard position. “Everyone has social media, definitely saw it. The competitor in Lonzo, of course he didn’t take it so well and, with his teammates behind him, we didn’t take it so well.”

Gortat appeared to find LaVar Ball’s warning to the Wizards — that they “better beware because Lonzo ain’t losing again [this week]” — laughable.

man….. pleaseeeeee!!! @JohnWall will torture him for 48min 😂😂😂😂

Wall, who has led the Wizards to a 3-0 record to start the season, turned Gortat’s vote of confidence into a more serious threat two days before the Los Angeles showdown.

“Nah, no mercy,” Wall told The Washington Post on Monday. “Certain matchups you really get up for. Like when you play Steph [Curry], you definitely want to have a good game. I’m playing against [Ball]. [Gortat] said what he said about me. I didn’t say anything. His dad has been talking … that makes me want to go out there and lead my team and play the best I can play.”

Ball, the No. 2 overall pick in the draft, has been a prime target of trash talk since he joined the league, as NBA stars watched LaVar enter the spotlight with bold praise for his eldest son.

The 19-year-old had a rude awakening in his first game, a loss to the Lakers in which he scored just three points, when Clippers guard Patrick Beverly called him a “weak-ass motherf—-r” outside the Lakers’ locker room and said afterward he “has to be ready” for taunts like that.

Ball said he pays no mind to the target on his back.

“That’s how I grew up, so that’s normal for me,” Ball said, adding, “I already know my teammates have my back. So we’re going to go out there, we’re going to play and hopefully get a win.”
