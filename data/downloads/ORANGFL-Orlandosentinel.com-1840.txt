A teacher at New Smyrna Beach Middle School was arrested Wednesday on charges that she was having sex with an eighth-grade boy, according to the Volusia County Sheriff’s Office.


Deputies say Stephanie Peterson, 26, picked the boy up at his home in the middle of the night on several occasions to have sex and smoke marijuana.


She also sent him nude photos and told him he couldn’t tell anyone about the relationship because they would get in trouble, the boy told deputies.


Authorities were called to the boy’s home Tuesday after he told his parents about the relationship, which began in November.


Peterson, also known as Stephanie Ferri, resigned from her job Monday.


She faces two counts of lewd or lascivious battery and one count of transmission of harmful materials to a minor. She was being held on a $25,000 bond at the Volusia County Jail.


Detectives are asking parents to talk to their children, and anyone with information about any other potential victims should call the Sheriff’s Office Child Exploitation Unit at 386-323-3574.
