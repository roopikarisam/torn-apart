A newborn baby was found abandoned at the Tucson International Airport, officials for the facility have confirmed Monday.

An airport employee reportedly made the discovery sometime on Sunday night in a bathroom located in a pre-security area, according to a spokesperson for the airport. The baby boy was found cleaned and wrapped up on a changing table.

The newborn was later transferred to a local hospital after first responders from the Tucson Airport Police and the Fire Department arrived to administer first aid and found the boy to be healthy. He will be placed in the care of social services following his release.

Airport officials have yet to determine whether the boy was born in the bathroom, or if he was transported there before being abandoned. Police are currently investigating with the aid of security footage, the Associated Press reports. The boy’s mother has not yet been identified.

Tuscon News Now adds that Arizona is a “safe haven” state, allowing parents to leave unwanted, unharmed infants to the care of the state without risking prosecution, but only at designated safe havens.

The Associated Press contributed to this report.
