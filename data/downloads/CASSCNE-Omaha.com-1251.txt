The scene after a train hit a car that was stuck on the train tracks. The driver had tried to cross the tracks at a spot not meant for vehicles, and his car became high-centered.

A 21-year-old man was arrested Sunday on suspicion of driving while intoxicated after he drove across train tracks where there wasn’t a crossing and got the car stuck on the tracks.

The man, who is from Omaha, tried to cross the tracks near Greenwood, Nebraska, about 6:45 a.m. Sunday.

The Lincoln MKZ was high-centered on the tracks, and the man left to find help to free the car. He was unsuccessful and returned.

As a train approached, its driver noticed something was on the tracks and “slowed considerably,” the Nebraska State Patrol said. The train still struck the car and pushed it 500 feet. The man was not in the car, and no one was injured.

The man, who was also ticketed for reckless driving and trespassing, is being held in the Cass County Jail.
