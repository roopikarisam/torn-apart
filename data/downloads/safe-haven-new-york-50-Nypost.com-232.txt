Cops executing a drug-search warrant at a Long Island home found 60 cockfighting roosters and a malnourished pit bull in the squalid backyard, authorities said.

Reynaldo Bonilla, 40, was arrested Friday after cops discovered the roosters — plus several hens, a pheasant and the suffering dog — in the feces-strewn backyard at his home on Fourth Street in Brentwood, according to police and a Suffolk County SPCA official.

The birds’ combs and the dangling wattles on their chins had been removed in preparation for battle, according to Roy Gross, the chief of the animal-protection group.

The female pit bull was “living in deplorable condition” in the yard with an untreated wound, he added.

A “significant quantity” of cocaine, marijuana, cash, scales and packaging materials were also discovered at Bonilla’s home on North Thompson Drive in Bay Shore, cops said.

He was charged with drug possession, criminal use of drug paraphernalia, animal cruelty and possession of items relating to cockfighting, including leg spurs, a cockfighting ring and training gloves, said officials.
