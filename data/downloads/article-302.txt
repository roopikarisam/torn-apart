Alcohol may have played a role in a crash in which a 22-year-old San Benito woman was killed after driving head-on into an oncoming car, sending three people to the hospital.


Kimberly Sandy Sandoval was pronounced dead at the scene on F.M. 732 south of Yost Road in San Benito at about 8 p.m. yesterday, Sgt. Maria Montalvo of the Texas Department of Public Safety stated today.

A preliminary investigation found Sandoval was alone driving southbound on F.M. 732 when her 2007 Dodge Charger veered into the northbound lane, crashing head-on with a northbound 2000 Chevrolet 1500 occupied by male driver and two passengers, Montalvo stated. The Chevrolet’s three occupants were taken to Valley Baptist Medical Center.


Montalvo stated investigators are awaiting a pending toxicology report.

“Alcohol might have been a contributing factor to this fatal crash,” she stated.


No other information was immediately available.
