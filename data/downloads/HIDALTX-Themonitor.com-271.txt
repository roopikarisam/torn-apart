Authorities have found the second suspect wanted in Sunday's strip club murder near Donna.


Hidalgo County Sheriff's Office investigators and the U.S. Marshals Service Gulf Coast Violent Offender Fugitive Task Force located Gabriel Hernandez, 22, of Weslaco, in Gonzalez, Louisiana — a small city southeast of Baton Rouge.

Hernandez turned himself in upon being located. He was booked into the Ascension Parish jail late Wednesday night, according to jail records.


He is accused of being involved in the shooting death of Angel Sanchez at LipZtick strip club near Donna on Oct. 1.

Miguel Uvalle, 41, of Weslaco, was charged with murder Wednesday in connection with the case and issued a $1 million bond.


Investigators believe the motive to be an ongoing dispute between Uvalle and Sanchez, who was “ambushed by a gunman" while walking out of the club's restroom, according to information provided by the sheriff's office.


Hernandez is awaiting extradition to Hidalgo County.
