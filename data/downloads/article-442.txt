SYRACUSE, N.Y. -- Syracuse police say they arrested a woman who stabbed her husband with a pocket knife during a fight early Sunday.

Tamora Weatherly, 32, of Syracuse, was charged with second-degree assault, a felony, and fourth-degree criminal possession of a weapon, a misdemeanor.

Officers were called to the Clinton Plaza Apartments, at 550 S. Clinton St., at 1:18 a.m. Sunday for a domestic-related stabbing, city police spokeswoman Sgt. Julie Shulsky said in a news release.

When they arrived, the victim told police he and Weatherly had been fighting and that she "became highly irate and stabbed him with a pocket knife," Shulsky said in the release. 

The victim had a one-inch cut to the left side of his chest. He was treated at Upstate University Hospital for non-life threatening injuries, police said.

Weatherly was still there when police arrived, Shulsky said in the release. Police took her into into custody.

Weatherly was sent to the Onondaga County Justice Center, where she remained Sunday afternoon, jail records show.
