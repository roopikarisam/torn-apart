GARFIELD - A city man was charged with assault by auto and DWI after an accident left a pedestrian in critical condition, authorities said Monday.

Patrick Maurikos, 65, was driving a vehicle that struck a pedestrian about 8:40 p.m. Saturday, according to Bergen County Prosecutor Gurbir S. Grewal.

Garfield police received several calls reporting the accident on Midland Avenue near Banta Avenue.

Officers found the man in the street suffering from multiple injuries, Grewal said.

The victim was taken to Hackensack University Medical Center, where he remained in critical but stable condition on Monday.

Maurikos was taken to the Bergen County Jail to await a court hearing, the prosecutor said.
