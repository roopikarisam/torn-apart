A 37-year-old North Bergen man was arrested after a struggle as he tried to leave the CVS Pharmacy on Bergenline Avenue with $138 worth of beauty products he didn't pay for, officials said.

Jose Chaparro, of the 1000 block of Paterson Plank Road, is charged with robbery and resisting arrest in connection to the incident on Sunday in the store located at 53rd Street.

Chaparro made his first appearance on the charges on Monday in Criminal Justice Reform Court in Jersey City via video link from Hudson County jail in Kearny.
