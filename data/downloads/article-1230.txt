A 35-year-old Jersey City woman has been charged with kneeing a police officer in the stomach as she was being escorted out of a building on Feb. 28.

Kimberly Sanders, of Lexington Avenue near Bergen Avenue, made her first court appearance on the charges of aggravated assault on a police officer and hindering apprehension on Feb. 28.

On the day of her arrest, officers were dispatched to a Bergen Avenue building on a report of a woman in the building doing drugs. When the officers found Sanders sitting on the steps near the third floor, she gave them a fake name and told them she did not live in the building, the complaint says.

The cops told her that if she did not live in the building then she had to leave. As they escorted her out, Sanders kicked the front door before turning and kneeing the officer in the abdomen, the complaint says.

The state moved to detain Sanders through the course of her prosecution when she made her first appearance on the charges in Criminal Justice Reform Court in Jersey via video link from Hudson County jail in Kearny last week.

Sanders was not charged with any drug offenses.
