President Trump has made it into the Most Magical Place on Earth: Walt Disney World.

Visitors at Disney's Magic Kingdom Park in Orlando, Fla., caught a glimpse of the commander-in-chief, along with his predecessors, at The Hall of Presidents exhibit on Monday.

The attraction officially reopens on Tuesday after a year-long transformation and has added a life-size figure of Trump, dressed in his signature suit, designed to move and speak in front of audiences during shows.

Trump personally recorded his words for The Hall of Presidents, just as every other President has since the 1990s, the park said in a blog post.

A sneak peek of the 45th President's figure surfaced on social media on Monday.

"From the beginning, America has been a nation defined by its people," Trump's figure says, flanked by Presidents Abraham Lincoln and Ulysses S. Grant.

Disney's tradition began in 1971 and had included every commander-in-chief since the attraction's inception.
