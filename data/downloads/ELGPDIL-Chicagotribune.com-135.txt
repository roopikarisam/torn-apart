Beginning next week and through the end of the month, the Elgin Police Department will be making concerted efforts to check for seat belt use and stop people from texting or talking on the phone while driving.


“People forget they are traveling in what can be a 2,000-pound weapon if not used properly,” said Lt. Jeff Adam, who heads the Elgin Police Department traffic division.


The Elgin City Council Wednesday unanimously approved accepting a $7,104 Illinois Department of Transportation Distracted Driving/Occupant Protection Grant to pay for the efforts. The money actually comes from the the U.S. Department of Transportation and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration through the state of Illinois, which extends the funding to local law enforcement agencies across the state.


The campaign also coincides with National Distracted Driving Awareness Month in April.


“This is a life-and-death situation,” Council member Terry Gavin said. “I’m all for this. It’s the right thing to do.”


According to the National Safety Council there were 1,080 traffic fatalities in Illinois in 2017, 1,078 deaths in 2016 and 1,017 in 2015. The council’s preliminary estimates have 40,100 traffic deaths across the country last year, a slight drop from 40,327 in 2016.


According to the National Center for Statistics and Analysis, every day across the United States approximately nine people are killed and more than 1,000 are hurt in crashes that reportedly involve distracted driving of some sort.


Adam thinks the number of accidents involving distracted driving is underreported. People won’t admit to being on the phone or otherwise distracted when involved in a crash, Adam said, so a citation will be written for another reason, such as driving too fast for conditions.

Adam said he’s seen and stopped people who have been playing video games on their phones while driving. And not too long ago, Adam pulled over a man at Kimball and State streets who was using the FaceTime app to be on a video phone call.


The saddest distracted driving accident Adam could recall happened about three years ago near the intersection of Highland and Lyle avenues on the city’s west side. It involved a pregnant woman who was not wearing a seat belt and who was on the phone when she hit a another car in a head-on collision. Even though both vehicles were traveling about 30 mph, the woman and her unborn baby died as a result of her injuries, Adam said.


Elgin has been using the Illinois Department of Transportation grant for seven years, Adam said. It started out with a focus on seat belts and has evolved to include distracted driving, he said.


The effort will involve saturation patrols, where a number of police officers set up at a stop sign or stoplight to check for those using seat belts and for those using their phones. Adam said that while seat belts and cell phones are the primary focus of such patrols in at least one instance they have also resulted DUI arrests.


Adam said there also will be roving patrols where officers on patrol will be looking for drivers who aren’t wearing their seat belts or who are on their phones. The grant is allowing more of such work to be done during daytime than it has in the past, which makes it easier to spot such violations, Adam said.


The officers assigned to these activities are paid on an overtime basis with all expenses reimbursed through the grant, Adam said.


Adam noted that Elgin police also work with the city’s high schools to give presentations related to distracted driving and seat belt use.


In the next few weeks, police also will ramp up a media campaign related to distracted driving. Adam said that will include social media posts about the topic, putting out press releases, appearances on local radio to discuss distracted driving and even using the electronic marquee sign outside The Centre downtown to get out the message.


According to police department records, Elgin officers wrote 270 occupant protection citations for drivers, passengers or child safety seat issues in 2011. That number was 681 in 2013; 1,575 in 2013; 1,078 in 2014; 764 in 2015; 358 in 2016 and 797 in 2017.


Elgin police wrote three citations for distracted driving in 2011, the first year it ticketed for such; 258 in 2012; 465 tickets in 2013; 1,751 in 2014; 1,434 in 2015; 1,547 in 2016 and 686 citations for distracted driving in 2017.


Adam said the dip in seat belt tickets in 2016 may have been due to no grant funding being available due to the state’s budget crisis. Fluctuations in numbers may also be due to shift in officer assignments, he said.
