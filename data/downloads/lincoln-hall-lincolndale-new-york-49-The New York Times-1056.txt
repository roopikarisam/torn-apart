To the Editor:


Re “Geffen Calls Lack of Aid for a Hall ‘Shameful’ ” (Arts pages, Oct. 5):


My sympathy to David Geffen, whose $100 million donation has been stranded because the $500 million total cost of the project to renovate the hall at Lincoln Center that bears his name could not be raised.


There are ways for donors to avoid having their donation stranded. Instead of giving $100 million outright, donors like Mr. Geffen should make their gifts contingent on an organization’s raising the balance of the required funds within a particular period.


Such practices nudge other donors into giving, and avoid the needless frustration and embarrassment of having to announce the cessation of a project that, with much fanfare, has already been announced. Donors will not react well to such an outcome.


Even so, Lincoln Center deserves praise for halting a project it cannot fund, despite the obvious negative public reaction it would — and did — evoke. Some foundations take the opposite approach; they forge ahead, only to end up in serious financial difficulties.

“Build it and they will come” is a catchy phrase, but it is not a philosophy that works well in the nonprofit world. Best to have the requisite funds in hand, and only then proceed.
