A former NBA player who went to high school in Cobb County was arrested Friday night in connection with an armed robbery in Coweta County, authorities confirmed.


James Edward "JJ" Hickson Jr., 29, was charged with armed robbery with a knife and is currently in the Coweta County Jail, according to jail records. He is being held without bond.


Hickson was charged in connection with a home invasion that happened on Rowe Road in Senoia Friday night, Coweta sheriff spokesman Jimmy Yarbrough confirmed.


At least two people were involved in the home invasion, but only Hickson faces charges, Yarbrough said. 


A number of personal items were allegedly taken and someone was attacked during the incident, Yarbrough said. Another department took Hickson into custody, and he was turned over to Coweta County afterward.


Hickson was a standout basketball player at Joseph Wheeler High School in Marietta and attended North Carolina State University before being drafted by the Cleveland Cavaliers with the 19th pick in the 2008 NBA Draft.


He would go on to play for the Cavaliers, Sacramento Kings, Portland Trail Blazers, Denver Nuggets and Washington Wizards throughout his eight-year NBA career. He most recently played basketball overseas for the Lebanon Champville SC team in 2018.


The Coweta County Sheriff’s Office couldn’t release or confirm any other details regarding Hickson’s arrest.
