Gasoline prices are too high 

SULLIVAN CITY — A Thursday morning traffic stop on Expressway 83 resulted in the seizure of more than 300 pounds of marijuana valued at more than $2 million.

After a Texas Department of Public Safety highway patrol trooper attempted to stop a minivan at 11:15 a.m. for a traffic violation, the driver stopped the vehicle in a brushy area and fled on foot, according to a DPS news release.

Approximately 340 pounds of marijuana was discovered in the van. DPS troopers later located and apprehended the driver, Ramiro Eden Clarke of Rio Grande City.


Clarke remains at the Hidalgo County jail on a combined $60,000 bond for possession of marijuana and evading arrest with a motor vehicle, both felony charges.
