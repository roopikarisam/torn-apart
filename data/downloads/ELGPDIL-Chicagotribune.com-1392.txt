It's Halloween, that day of the year when kids dress up as their favorite Marvel superhero, "Walking Dead" zombie or Disney princess and ring neighborhood doorbells begging for candy and threatening pranks if they don't get any.


Against that backdrop of fun and tomfoolery comes Illinois Attorney General Lisa Madigan with a warning: check the state's sex offender registry before you head out to trick or treat.


“The number of known sex offenders throughout Illinois is extremely alarming, and they do not live in any one neighborhood or community; they live in every part of our state," Madigan said in a statement.


Lest you think that was a bit of alarmist hyperbole from the outgoing attorney general, her office included some stats: there are more than 30,200 registered sex offenders on the Illinois State Police's list, and more than 24,700 of those committed a crime against a child.


At any rate, state law bars sex offenders who committed a crime against a child from distributing candy or others items to children on Halloween.


 

What's on tap


*Mayor Rahm Emanuel will speak at the National Association of City Transportation Officials Annual Conference in the morning. Later, he'll announce a new scholarship program at Robert Morris University and in the evening take part in Halloween activities at two parks.


*Gov. Bruce Rauner is on a trade mission to Israel. That means he won't be at the Executive Mansion giving away candy while dressed as the Cat in the Hat, like in 2015.


*Chicago City Council budget hearings continue, with Streets and Sanitation Department the headliner, and Public Health and the License Appeal Commission on the undercard.


*Cook County budget hearings continue, with a 9 a.m. public session on board President Toni Preckwinkle's proposed 2018 spending plan. That's the one commissioners have to figure out how to cut $200 million from after repealing the pop tax earlier this month.


*An Illinois House committee is set to have a first hearing on House Speaker Michael Madigan's sexual harassment bill at the Bilandic Building.


*Democratic U.S. Rep. Luis Gutierrez is scheduled to speak to the City Club of Chicago. Watch a livestream around 8 a.m. here. 


 


From the notebook  


*Domestic violence time off: Mayor Emanuel on Monday backed providing one month’s pay to city employees who are victims of domestic violence or sexual assault so it’s easier for them to take time off to deal with related issues. Under state law, public workers are allowed up to three months of unpaid leave — which three city employees have used since the law went into effect three years ago.


The idea is to prevent workers from making “a false choice ... between seeking care and a paycheck,” Emanuel said. The city also aims to “lead by example” and encourage private sector employers to take similar steps, Emanuel said.


To make the change, the City Council would have to approve a new ordinance to be introduced by Emanuel and Ald. Matthew O’Shea, 19th. The measure also would require the city’s Human Resources Department to provide training to heighten awareness and recognize signs of abuse. (Hal Dardick)


*Quick spins: The reappointment of attorney William F. Conlon as chairman of the Chicago Board of Ethics was approved without fanfare. Conlon had taken a strong stand on illegal lobbying violations found in Emanuel's emails, drew criticism, then backed off a bit late last week. ... Aviation Commissioner Ginger Evans gave aldermen an update on the foul-smelling, noise-reducing windows that some near Midway Airport have complained about. The city will test the windows, and there are 149 confirmed cases so far, Evans said.


*City Council free lunch: Monday's City Council budget buffet was sponsored by 25th Ward Ald. Danny Solis: a variety of tamales, flautas, enchiladas and two kinds of stew.
