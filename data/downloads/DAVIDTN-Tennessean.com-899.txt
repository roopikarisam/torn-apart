Karl Dean defended his home turf Thursday night, defeating House Minority Leader Craig Fitzhugh in a Davidson County Democratic Party straw poll on next year’s Tennessee governor’s race by a decisive 200-87 vote.


It might seem like a small feat for Dean, considering he was mayor of Nashville from 2007 to 2015. But Dean fell short against Fitzhugh in the same poll of Nashville Democratic activists taken this time last year.


Dean’s campaign was quick to claim victory in a new release after the results, a margin of 70 percent to 30 percent, came in.


“I am thrilled by the support of the Davidson County Dems,” Dean said.


The straw poll was taken at the annual Davidson County Democratic Party holiday party and fundraiser at the Nashville Bridge Building Thursday night.


Fresh off dropping out of the U.S. Senate race, Democrat James Mackler, a Nashville attorney and Iraq War veteran addressed the crowd and formally endorsed former Gov. Phil Bredesen.


He called for party unity in the race to replace retiring U.S. Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tennessee.


“This is the time for unity and there is no time to waste which is why I am happy to be endorsing Phil Bredesen for U.S. Senate,” Mackler said.


Bredesen said he’s honored to receive Mackler’s support and that he looks forward to watching the work of a new political action committee, dubbed Believe in Service, that Mackler has launched to back federal candidates who agree to protect and expand national service programs like AmeriCorps.
