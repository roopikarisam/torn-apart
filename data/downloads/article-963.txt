An Orlando father is being charged with first-degree murder after he allegedly killed his daughter during a power outage from Hurricane Irma, jail records show.

Dekari Castell, 22, is also charged with aggravated child abuse. He is accused of striking his 6-month-old daughter Kali twice on the head, according to a police affidavit obtained by the Orlando Sentinel.

The baby was unresponsive and taken to the hospital on Sept. 13. She died the next day.

The incident took place in the same home where police found and arrested Markeith Loyd earlier this year for allegedly killing Orlando Police Lt. Debra Clayton.

Castell's story to police reportedly changed numerous times throughout the investigation.

He first told them he accidentally dropped the baby, then said she fell from the TV stand, police told FOX 35. He also said that he was throwing the baby in the air and she fell.

Castell finally allegedly admitted to police that he struck the baby twice in the head when she would not stop crying, saying he was "highly stressed being without power during the hurricane."

He was booked on Monday and appeared before a judge the next day.

Castell — who has the name of his deceased daughter tattooed above his left eyebrow — is being held without bond in the Orange County Jail.
