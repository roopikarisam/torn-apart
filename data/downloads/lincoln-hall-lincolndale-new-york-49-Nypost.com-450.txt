Mike Bloomberg took pot shots at Donald Trump and the Koch brothers as he presided over his inaugural “Bloomberg 50” shindig at Gotham Hall Monday.

The former Big Apple mayor grudgingly gave Trump credit as a branding genius for “slapping his name on everything he owned” — a move that Bloomberg admitted knows a thing or two about, joking that he may have heard it on Bloomberg Radio or seen it on Bloomberg TV. 

The Wall Street billionaire likewise took a swipe at Charles and David Koch, who are backing Meredith’s takeover of Time Inc. 

“Other people are already copying the Bloomberg 50,” said Bloomberg, fibbing that Time magazine was going to split its Time 100 gala next spring into two Time 50 lists. 

That is because “The Koch brothers couldn’t agree on a list,” Bloomberg sniped. 

Time declined to comment, but reportedly has no real plan to split its list in two. 

The Time 100, staged annually at the Jazz at Lincoln Center venue, still pulls the paparazzi to a star-studded event with big-time entertainment and a turnout of the biggest stars. 

The Bloomberg 50 was staged in the relatively dark Gotham Hall with little buzz and only 19 of the 50 honorees on hand.
