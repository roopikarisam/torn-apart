A Florida mother visiting an inmate ended up behind bars herself for allegedly leaving her child unattended in a hot car.

According to the Orange County Sheriff's Office, 21-year-old Rachael Etienne was arrested Sunday after her 3-year-old child was found in the backseat of a vehicle parked in the visitor's center of the Orange County Jail.

Deputy Ingrid Tejada-Monforte told the Orlando Sentinel that Etienne was visiting someone at the jail and left the child behind.

She said corrections personnel making their rounds found the child, and jail employees were able to get the toddler out of the vehicle.

An affidavit states that the child was drenched in sweat but is expected to be okay. Authorities said it was 90 degrees outside Sunday and the child had been in the vehicle for almost 20 minutes.

Etienne initially told officers that she had left her child in the vehicle with a teenager, but when cops told her surveillance video proved otherwise she allegedly confessed and said she made a mistake.

Etienne was arrested but released a few hours later on bond. News 13 reports that Etienne has a hearing with the Department of Children and Families to determine if she will get the child back. The toddler is currently in the care of a family member.
