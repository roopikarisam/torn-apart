A Hackensack man was arrested Friday on charges he made a bomb threat against the Bergen County Courthouse, officials said.

Christopher Camargo, 25, of Union Street, used technology to conceal his phone number on Feb. 5 when he called the Hackensack Police Department and made the bomb threat, according to acting Bergen County Prosecutor Dennis Calo.

The courthouse is located on Main Street in Hackensack.

Members of the Bergen County Prosecutor's Office Cyber Crimes Unit and Hackensack Police Department were eventually able to trace the call, Calo said.

Camargo is charged with second-degree making a false public alarm against a critical infrastructure and third-degree terroristic threats, the prosecutor said.

He was held in the Bergen County Jail pending a court hearing.

According to jail records, Camargo was charged April 12 with a drug court violation.
