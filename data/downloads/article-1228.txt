When police caught an alleged bike thief red-handed in Jersey City Thursday, there was no foot pursuit, struggle or dramatic confrontation.

Instead, police say, the man simply said: "You got me."

John Pachecho, 52, of Bergen Avenue in Jersey City, was arrested around 8 p.m. on the plaza level of the Journal Square Transportation Center after police saw him removing a bicycle from a rack near the Starbucks, Port Authority police spokesman Joe Pentangelo said.

Pachecho, who was charged with theft, had an open warrant out of Jersey City and was also charged with bail jumping. He was taken to Hudson County jail in Kearny, Pentangelo added.

After an arrest in 2013, The Jersey Journal reported that Pachecho had 20 previous arrests -- 14 of which were for offenses related to burglaries, theft or robbery. One was for weapons possession, authorities said.
