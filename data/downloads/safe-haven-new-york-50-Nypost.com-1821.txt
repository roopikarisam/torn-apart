A physical education teacher was caught stripping naked and chasing children around a playground in a bizarre video circulating online.

Parents are outraged after footage surfaced of the Carthay Center Elementary School teacher exposing himself to nearby second-grade and fifth-grade students Friday on the Los Angeles campus, news station KCAL reported.

The video was reportedly captured by a construction worker who started filming the man, who was not identified, as he put his pants back on in the middle of the playground.

“He was supposed to be helping them learn P.E., run around and have fun,” a parent told KCAL. “But he undressed and started chasing the kids while he was naked, and then the kids ducked and dodged, ran into some of the classrooms and got safe haven that way.”

School officials reportedly notified parents of the horrifying episode in a robocall and letter sent home with students.

Counselors were also made available to students in light of the incident.

No charges have been filed against the man but authorities are investigating the case, KCAL reported.
