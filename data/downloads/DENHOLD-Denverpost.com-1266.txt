The Ashlawn Estate brings Southern plantation-style architecture to the Front Range, and it’s for sale, listed at $22.2 million.

The property’s more than 13,000-square-foot main house took three years to build. It could have been plucked from a scene in “Gone With The Wind” and nestled into its 118-acre plot west of Longmont.

“When you see other Colorado homes, they aren’t the look of the Ashlawn Estate,” said LIV Sotheby’s International Realty listing agent Josh McKinley. “It’s for a certain person aesthetically. A lot of people love the mountain modern home or the ranch style home or the elegant wood beam home. This has none of that. It has white beams and white columns out front. It’s very clean looking.”

A grand staircase with hand-carved balusters commands the entrance of the home. (An original set of plans for the property is hidden inside one of them.) Inside the house, an impressive parlor is primed to entertain guests in large numbers.

“The finest hotel bar you could possibly go into would not compare to this,” McKinley said. “It is spectacular.”

The parlor opens to one of several patios with wood-burning fireplaces. The patio faces northwest, exposing magnificent views of Longs Peak.

“The whole house was designed for entertaining,” McKinley said. “The home is built to hold quite a bit of people.”

Also on the property is a 2,000-square-foot guest home, a couple of polo fields and a stable with an apartment that hosts Argentinian polo players.

The two polo fields double as a landing pad for aircrafts. But, if navigating a real aircraft is too daunting, there’s a flight simulator in the basement that also functions as a safe room. It’s built inside an actual plane cockpit.


This property backs up to Haystack Mountain, creating a private retreat with quick access to Boulder and Denver.

“It’s the most unique property on the front range given the size, scope and views,” McKinley said. “While you’re on 118 acres, it seems even larger. There’s no one around you. The setting is just fantastic — minutes from Boulder, minutes from Denver, but you feel like you’re on the other side of the world.”
