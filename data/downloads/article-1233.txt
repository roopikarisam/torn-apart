One person has been arrested and another is being sought after the pair tried to run down a loss-prevention officer following a theft at the Walmart in Secaucus, authorities said.

Blanca Menendez, 57, of Union City, and an accomplice stole $132 worth of baby clothing from the store on June 13, Secaucus Police Capt. Dennis Miller said.

The getaway vehicle, driven by the man being sought, was seen on surveillance footage as targeting the store security officers,  Miller said. The surveillance video also captured an image of the license plate, and police eventually found the getaway vehicle in Union City.

On June 21 Menendez surrendered at Secaucus police headquarters and she was charged with robbery, conspiracy to commit robber and hindering apprehension, Miller said.



Miller said Menendez also had two outstanding warrants totaling $458 from North Bergen and Union City. She was processed and transported to Hudson County jail.
