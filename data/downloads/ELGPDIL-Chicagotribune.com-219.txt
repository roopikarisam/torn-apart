Police in Rockford logged the most arrests last year for driving under the influence, according to a survey by the Alliance Against Intoxicated Motorists.


The Schaumburg-based nonprofit organization asked for DUI arrest data for 2017 from nearly 700  police departments across the state and received responses from 81 percent of the departments, according to a news release from the organization. Chicago was not ranked in this survey due to its size.


The Rockford Police Department arrested 490 drivers for DUI in 2017, followed by Elgin with 418 and Decatur with 391. Cicero came in fourth place with 341. The rest of the top 10 were Aurora (326), Lombard (313), Carol Stream (291), Springfield (288), Naperville (271) and Normal (246).


Alliance Against Intoxicated Motorists, which has been conducting the study for the past 28 years with  a grant from the Illinois Department of Transportation, also found that the top DUI cop in 2017 was Illinois State Police Trooper Eric David with 208 arrests. Chicago police Officer Timothy Walter of the 19th District came in second with 167 arrests.


Chicago wasnâ€™t listed in the survey, but AAIM noted the city had 1,982 DUI arrests in 2017, down 23.5 percent from 2016.
