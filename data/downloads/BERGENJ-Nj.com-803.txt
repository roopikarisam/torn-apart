A New Jersey man who won a $338 million Powerball jackpot four years ago has been charged with repeatedly sexually assaulting a child.

A Newark police officer was arrested for the third time in two years -- this time on an aggravated assault charge stemming from an alleged domestic incident.

The two are among a group of people either charged with, indicted for, convicted of or sentenced in a wide array of crimes that made news across New Jersey in the past week.
