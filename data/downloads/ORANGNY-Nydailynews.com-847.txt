A high school art teacher accused of having sex with four students was arrested Wednesday.

Jessie Lorene Goline, 25, faces one count of first-degree sexual assault because only one of the students, who she thought was 18, turned out to be "way younger than what he told her," according to an affidavit cited by the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette.

Goline admitted to having sex with four students from both the Marked Tree School District and the East Poinsett County School District between January and April of 2016, the affidavit states.

The four students said Goline would send them text messages that grew increasingly sexual over time, the Democrat-Gazette reported.

One of the alleged victims said Goline commented on his looks in class and sent him a photo of herself wearing a thong.

Goline also brought two of the students back to her apartment and had sex with them in separate incidents on the same day, authorities said.

An investigation was launched in April after officials at Marked Tree High School learned about a parent who accused Goline of having sex with multiple students and threatened to inflict "bodily harm."
