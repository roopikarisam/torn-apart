A former Woodcliff Lake rabbi has been charged with sexually assaulting a boy in 1999, according to the Bergen County Prosecutor's Office.

Menachem A. Weiss, 46, of Los Angeles, was indicted by a Bergen County grand jury on March 22 on two counts of aggravated sexual assault.

Weiss is a married teacher but the prosecutor's office did not say where he teaches.

Woodcliff Lake police received information in December 2016 that a boy was sexually assaulted by Weiss between January and June 1999 when he lived in the borough, authorities said.

Weiss was arrested by the Port Authority police and was being held in the Bergen County jail pending a detention hearing.
