A Cheatham County juvenile has been missing since Oct. 13, the Cheatham County Sheriff’s Office reported Wednesday evening.


Jazmyne Lexis Hollars, 15, apparently ran away after refusing to return home from a friends house and has not come back since.


Sheriff Mike Breedlove said in a text to the Times that her family has heard she is currently located in California or Colorado, but said that those claims are unsubstantiated.


Her family reported she may also be in Dickson or Davidson Counties, according to the Cheatham County Sheriff's Office.


Anyone with information regarding Hollars’ whereabouts should call the Cheatham County Sheriff's Office at  (615) 792-2098.
