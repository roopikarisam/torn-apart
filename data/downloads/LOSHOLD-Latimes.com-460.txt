What to do with all that art? 

As artists fall into disgrace for a range of allegations having to do with sexual misconduct, Times theater critic Charles McNulty wonders whether their art must be consigned to oblivion. He writes: "But inevitably a contemporary artist with whom I feel a special kinship will shatter my illusions about his or her character. I doubt that I will throw away the books or delete the recordings or swear off the films. I'm sure I'll be disillusioned and quite possibly disgusted, but I know that an artist is not identical with his or her masterpieces and that few human beings can live up to their greatest achievements." Los Angeles Times

AND FINALLY

Today's California memory comes from Nancy Price: 

"I was born in Santa Monica in 1952 and lived in the San Fernando Valley most of my life until I was 39 and then I moved my family to Oregon. What I miss the most is the sunshine and warmer weather that California has to offer all year long. I have so many wonderful memories of growing up in California, and my heart will always stay there. My best memories of my life were going to POP (Pacific Ocean Park) as a child and the huge bubbles that would come out as you entered the amusement park. Then as I became a teenager my siblings and I would all hop into my cousin Greg's VW bug back in 1969, take the shortcut through Sunset and end up at Sorrento Beach for the day. Everyone pitched in a quarter for gas and we would bring the baby oil and the Lemon Go Lightly that we would put in our hair to make it lighter and spend the day renting the rafts and riding the waves and sunbathing. The little building they had there for food had the best French fries and burgers. We would bring a radio and listen to the Beach Boys, Jan and Dean and all the awesome hits they had back then on KRLA. And about 4:30 p.m. we would fight the traffic and head on home. Life was so good back then, and you may not be able to ever go back to the way things were, but you will always have your memories."
