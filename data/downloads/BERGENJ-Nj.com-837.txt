JERSEY CITY -- A 37-year-old North Bergen man was arrested after a struggle as he tried to leave the CVS Pharmacy on Bergenline Avenue with $138 worth of beauty products without paying, officials said. 

Jose Chaparro, of the 1000 block of Paterson Plank Road, is charged with robbery and resisting arrest in connection to the incident on Sunday in the store located at 53rd Street, the criminal complaint says.

The use or threat of force while committing a theft or while fleeing following a theft elevates the offense to the more serious charge of robbery. It is a second degree crime, carrying a possible sentence of five to 10 years in prison upon conviction. 

Chaparro made his first appearance on the charges on Monday in Criminal Justice Reform Court in Jersey City via video link from Hudson County jail in Kearny.

At the hearing, the state moved to detain him through the course of his prosecution. A detention hearing is set for tomorrow before Hudson County Superior Court Judge Paul DePascale in the Hudson County Administration Building in Jersey City.
