Brooklyn Councilman Jumaane Williams and "Star Trek: First Contact" actor James Cromwell decried Albany corruption during a protest over a power plant on Wednesday.

The Wawayanda, New York, plant is at the center of a corruption trial involving former Gov. Cuomo aide Joseph Percoco and energy executive Peter Galbraith Kelly.

Prosecutors have alleged that Kelly heaped some $300,000 in bribes on Percoco so that his company, Competitive Power Ventures, could get crucial state contracts.

"There's nobody that can deny that there was money buying things in Albany," said Williams, who is weighing a run for lieutenant governor against Gov. Cuomo's No. 2, Kathy Hochul. "That is what's happening."

"It's either illegal or it's completely accepted and no one is doing anything about it," Williams said outside Manhattan Federal Court. "Both of those things are atrocious."

Williams said that while those in power have claimed to want change, there needs to be "more than lip service."

"And I've seen from the gubernatorial mansion a lot of lip service in the past few years," Williams said.

Cromwell, who lives some 10 miles from the CPV plant, said it's "built by corruption both in the statehouse and in the local counsel."

"Albany has to be one of the most corrupt statehouses in the union," said Cromwell, who also starred in "Babe" and "L.A. Confidential."

Cromwell, 78, was reportedly hit in June with a seven-day jail sentence related to protesting CPV's plant.
