KEARNY -- Less than 48 hours after telling police he wanted to jump off a bridge during a West New York arrest, a 26-year-old man was found hanging in his jail cell yesterday morning.

The man, whose name is being withheld pending the notification of his family, previously indicated to medical personnel at the jail that he had suicidal thoughts, officials said.

The jail death was the sixth since June, four of which have been classified as suicides. Officials have signaled a county contract with an outside medical provider could soon be terminated.

At about 9 a.m., authorities at the jail found the man hanging from his bed with a laundry bag tied around his neck, county spokesman Jim Kennelly said. He had already eaten breakfast and made telephone calls before he returned back to his bunk, he said.

The man was pronounced dead at Jersey City Medical Center at about 10:30 a.m.Kennelly said the man was picked up by the West New York Police Department on Friday on open warrants out of that city and North Bergen. Charges against him included domestic violence, aggravated assault, animal cruelty, resisting arrest, and eluding.

But during that arrest he yelled "I want to jump off a bridge." Police brought him to Palisade Medical Center for evaluation where he was cleared to be released into custody, officials said.

He indicated during his intake at the jail he had mental health issues, though he did not report being suicidal. The man did, however, tell medical professionals at the jail previously he has suicidal thoughts.

Those records do not appear to have been properly reviewed on Friday, Kennelly said, and the man was housed in general population instead of a mental health ward.

CFG Health Services, which has a $29.4 million contract at the jail, has come under fire in the past year. Inmates have reported receiving shoddy medical care and two of the suicides happened while those inmates were on mental health watch.

Hudson County Executive Tom DeGise is scheduled to meet with staff at the jail this afternoon.

"I am outraged at what has been presented to me in this case,"DeGise said in a statement. "If it is true, I can assure you CFG's contract at the jail will be terminated ASAP."

CFG did not immediately return a request for comment.
