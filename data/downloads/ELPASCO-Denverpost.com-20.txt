Fountain police arrested a 27-year-old man late Monday night for investigation of first-degree murder in the Monday night shooting death of his father, authorities say.

David Porter is being held at the El Paso County Criminal Justice Center without bond in the fatal shooting of his father, Michael Porter, 53, according to Sgt. D. Scott Gilbertsen, spokesman for the Fountain Police Department.

At 10:27 p.m., Fountain police responded to reports of a shooting incident in the 100 block of Cherry Circle. They found Michael Porter suffering from multiple gunshot wounds, Gilbertson’s news release says.

“The suspect also lived in the home with the victim and it is believed the shooting occurred during a family disturbance,” the news release says.
