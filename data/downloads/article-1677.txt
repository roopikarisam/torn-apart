Vandals who think of themselves as heroes have splashed the statue of a great American President with red liquid because, they say, "it is bloody at its very foundation," for it "embodies the violent historical foundation of the United States," not to mention "the underlying dynamics of oppression in our contemporary world."

So says a statement on the website of the Monument Removal Brigade justifying Thursday's vigilante attack on the monument, on the steps of the American Museum of Natural History, of Teddy Roosevelt on horseback.

(Oh, and they also salute those who stand for "popular self-defense at the frontiers of gentrification in the Bronx," whatever that means.)

If the brigade is true to its words, it must now waste no time in targeting the statue of white supremacist Abraham Lincoln ("I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races") in Union Square.

And the monument to George Washington, slave owner, inside Federal Hall downtown.

And definitely the Little Italy tribute to Fiorello LaGuardia â€” who barred Japanese nationals from meeting in groups after Pearl Harbor.

And then get enough of that blood-red liquid, whatever it is, to turn the Hudson River red. After all, it was Henry who started the fur trade and set in motion this whole mess of a city and nation the vandals loathe with every fiber of their being.
