YAKIMA, Wash. (AP) — The basement of the Yakima County jail remains shut down due to flooding.

But the Yakima Herald-Republic reports that it’s expected to be operational by Tuesday.

Jeremy Welch, Yakima County Department of Corrections chief, said crews are working on cleaning the basement and checking computers and other electronics to make sure they’re still functional. The jail’s court proceedings have been moved to the Yakima County Superior Court after a pipe burst and flooded the jail’s basement.

Welch said the broken pipe, which is used to run the air conditioner, was found early Monday morning dumping water into the basement.
