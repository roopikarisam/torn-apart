Former Gov. Chris Christie is warning President Donald Trump that taking action to fire Special Counsel Robert Mueller could cause him big problems.


While the former governor said the president is very angry about Monday’s FBI raid on the offices of his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, he understands the consequences if he were to dismiss Mueller, according to a report on NJ.com


Christie is not the only Republican warning Trump not to take action against Mueller. Some prominent Republicans in Congress have also warned against dismissing Mueller, and reports have indicated the president’s advisors have also warned against the move.


Quote of the Day: “At some point, you either crush the golden goose or it … flies away to Florida. Either way, you don’t get those golden eggs.” — Sen. Declan O’Scanlon, warning against Gov. Phil Murphy’s planned tax hikes.
