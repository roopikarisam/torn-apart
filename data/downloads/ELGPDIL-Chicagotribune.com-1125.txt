A former Elgin library board member was convicted Tuesday stealing campaign signs during last spring’s municipal elections.


A Cook County jury deliberated for 45 minutes before convicting Randall “Randy” Hopp, 66, of misdemeanor theft in the April incident.


Judge James Karahalios then sentenced Hopp to 14 months of conditional discharge, a form of probation, and 10 days of community service with the Cook County Sheriff’s department. The judge said he would not impose a fine or court costs, noting Hopp was indigent and unemployed.


Hopp was charged in April after police were notified that he was seen placing campaign signs for Elgin Councilman Rich Dunne in the back of his vehicle. Police recovered several of Dunne’s campaign signs from the vehicle and dozens more from other campaigns at Hopp’s home in the 1500 block of Pamela Drive.


Hopp was a candidate for the Gail Borden Public Library District board but lost. He previously served on that board but was banned a short time after his election from using the library as a patron. He lost the seat in 2013.
