A woman is behind bars after her 2-year-old was found alone in a hot car parked at a Disney resort.

According to WFTV 9, the child was discovered in an unlocked vehicle in the employee parking lot at Disney's Grand Floridian Resort &amp; Spa at about 1:15 p.m. on Monday.

The windows were cracked a few inches and the car was not running at the time, the station reported.

Orange County Deputy Ingrid Tejada-Monforte told the outlet the girl's mother, 37-year-old Myriam Lubincadet, was arrested and charged with child neglect.

WFTV 9 reported that after the child was found by Walt Disney World security, she was taken to Florida Hospital Celebration Health. She was listed in stable condition at the time.

The Orlando Sentinel reports that Lubincadet claims she agreed to babysit the girl while the child's mother was in labor and left the child in the car while she went inside the resort to get her manager's approval to take the afternoon off to care for the child.

The temperature in the child safety seat in which the girl was found was 113.5 degrees by the time another employee found the child "crying and sweating profusely" the Sentinel reports.

Lubincadet reportedly told the Sentinel that she only meant to leave the child for about five minutes while she talked to her manager.

She was released from Orange County Jail on Tuesday after posting bond.

A spokesperson for Disney reportedly told WESH that Lubincadet has been placed on leave from the Grand Floridian.
