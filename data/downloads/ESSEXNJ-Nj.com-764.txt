NEWARK -- An East Orange man threatened to disarm and shoot a Port Authority police officer after she stopped him for evading the PATH train fare at Newark Penn Station, officials said Wednesday.

Elijah F. Myers used a handicapped turnstile door to enter the station without paying Monday evening, according to Port Authority police spokesman Joe Pentangelo.

Officers told Myers to leave the train before he made the threats, started shouting and refused to leave, Pentangelo said. 

He kicked and flailed his arms as police tried to remove him from the train, the spokesman said. Officers used pepper spray to subdue Myers.

Police found Myers had a pipe that contained suspected cocaine residue, according to officials. He was charged with offenses, including aggravated assault on a police officer, resisting arrest and drug possession.

Officials said emergency medical crews treated the officers at the scene.

Records show Myers remained held at the Essex County Correctional Facility Wednesday.
