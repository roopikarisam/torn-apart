Since Sunday, Bobby Eardley was hit with shrapnel fleeing the Las Vegas concert massacre, watched his boyfriend die before his eyes in the shooting, and spent the first night of the rest of his life without the love of his life by his side.

"He's with his children right now, in solitude," his mother Joyce Eardley told the Daily News Tuesday. "He's home, which we feel is a tender mercy."

Bobby Eardley, 28, lives with his three children in St. George, Utah.

"He loved life," Joyce Eardley, 64, said through tears of her son's slain boyfriend, Cameron Robinson, 28, who she said was like a second father to her three young grandchildren.

"He loved people and to serve people — he was a character, he had us all laughing. We could be in the dumps and then he'd have us all in laughter," she said. "A great loss of a great man."

Robinson worked as a management analyst for the City of Las Vegas, according to his LinkedIn page. He commuted over 100 miles to his job each day from the couple's St. George home.

The city worker was shot in the neck on Sunday when gunman Stephen Paddock unleashed a roaring cascade of bullets upon him and other country music concertgoers from his room on the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel, Robinson's sister Meghan Ervin told the Las Vegas Review-Journal.

Eardley, 28, suffered shrapnel wounds to his lower back during the bloodshed. But it's the mental wounds that will leave the deepest scars.

"He will heal outside — it'll take a long time inside," Eardley's mother said.

As the hours passed following the massacre which left 59 dead and 527 injured, tributes to Robinson poured in on social media.

"I woke up, well I didn't sleep and if I did then I am still in this nightmare," Ervin posted on Facebook Monday.

"Today to go say goodbye to you! I was never supposed to say goodbye to you, little brother … you were supposed to take over the world."

A GoFundMe  page has been set up to help raise money for Robinson's funeral.
