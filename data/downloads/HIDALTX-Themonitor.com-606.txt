Miguel Uvalle, 41, of Weslaco, was charged with murder in connection with a murder at LipZtick strip club near Donna.

EDINBURG — A man accused of fatally shooting another man at a rural Donna strip club last October was arraigned Thursday.


Miguel Angel Uvalle, 41, appeared before state District Judge Bobby Flores and entered a not guilty plea on the first-degree felony charge of murder.

Uvalle is charged with shooting Angel Sanchez, 41, Oct. 1, 2017, at Lipztick Night Club.


Sheriff’s investigators believe the shooting stemmed from an ongoing personal dispute between the two, according to a sheriff’s department news release.

Uvalle remains in the custody of the Hidalgo County Sheriff’s Office and his bond is set at $1 million.


A second suspect in the shooting, Gabriel Hernandez, was arraigned last December, also on a murder charge. His trial is tentatively set for March 19.


He too remains in jail on a $500,000 bond.
