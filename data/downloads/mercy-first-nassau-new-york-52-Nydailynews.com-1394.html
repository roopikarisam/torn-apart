        "articleBody": "Eliza Dushku&#039;s disturbing account of her sexual assault on the set of &#034;True Lies&#034; was met with a chorus of support Sunday from co-star Jamie Lee Curtis, her former agent and a longtime friend, among others.Dushku alleged Saturday that she was molested by stunt coordinator Joel Kramer in a hotel room when she was just 12 years old and filming &#034;True Lies&#034; in Miami.Curtis, who played the actress&#039;s mother in the James Cameron action flick, penned a guest column for HuffPost divulging that Dushku had shared the story with her several years ago — and that child abuse within the industry deserved a larger spotlight.&#034;(Dushku) had shared that story with me privately a few years ago. I was shocked and saddened then and still am today,&#034; she wrote. &#034;What compounds the difficulty here is that the stunt coordinator in question was literally in charge of our lives, our safety… What allegedly happened to Eliza, away from the safety net of all of us and our purview is a terrible, terrible thing to learn about and have to reconcile.&#034;Meanwhile, several members of Dushku&#039;s inner circle told Deadline that they tried to hold Kramer accountable shortly after Dushku reported the incident, but had no luck.JoAnne Colonna, Dushku&#039;s agent at the time, confirmed to Deadline that she was the &#034;tough adult female friend in whom I had confided my terrible secret&#034; that the actress referenced in her Facebook post.Colonna told the outlet that prior to the alleged assault, she&#039;d reached out several times to the film&#039;s executive producer Rae Sanchini to express concerns over inappropriate behavior she witnessed on set.&#034;I&#039;d called Rae multiple times because there was such inappropriateness going on the set. There was sexual talk to (Eliza) and at her at various occasions,&#034; Colonna said.Sanchini brushed aside Colonna&#039;s concerns the first time around — and again when Colonna reported the alleged assault.&#034;Nobody really did anything,&#034; she said.When that proved a bust, she tried casting director Mali Finn, but was told to tread carefully in moving forward with the accusation.&#034;I&#039;ve read all the stories about Mira Sorvino. There is a reason why nobody comes forward; everyone was so afraid that they would get blacklisted and fired,&#034; Colonna said.Sue Booth-Forbes, Dushku&#039;s legal guardian at the time of filming, said in a statement to the Daily News that she reported the incident to no avail.&#034;I was on the &#039;True Lies&#039; set for 3 weeks and reported Joel Kramer&#039;s inappropriate sexual behavior towards 12-year-old Eliza to a person in authority. I was met with blank stares and had the sense that I wasn&#039;t telling that person anything they didn&#039;t already know. I tried to keep Joel away from her as did others working on the set, but because of all the stunts she had to do, he was constantly involved with her and her body. Those who knew didn&#039;t know what to do and were far enough down the pecking order to be afraid of losing their jobs if they pressed the issue because all the power lay in the hands of those who called the shots and would stop at nothing to protect each other,&#034; she said.&#034;That was years ago when that power structure was the norm, and the bullies were in charge. Only now does it appear that women and men know what to do and are doing it. May Eliza be believed and supported and may her courage in telling her truth make a contribution to the sea change that is in progress.&#034;Meanwhile, both Dushku&#039;s mother, Judith, and longtime friend Peter Conti confirmed that Dushku had informed them of Kramer&#039;s alleged behavior, but that she was afraid to go public out of fear of not being believed.&#034;She said she was afraid (to confront him) because he was in charge of her stunts,&#034; Conti told Deadline. &#034;She said it&#039;s her word against his and no one would believe her. I regret not handling it differently. What clouded my judgment is that JoAnne repeatedly went to the producer and nothing happened. How the hell were they going to listen to me?&#034;Added Judith in a Facebook comment on her daughter&#039;s post, &#034;It was not her career that I feared for, as that meant nothing to me. I was afraid of Joel Kramer, too. .. At the time, Eliza was too scared to tell the whole story and in a way I think she protected me from knowing because she knew how frightened I was of the powerful men on set.&#034;Kramer, whose lengthy résumé includes &#034;Blade Runner 2049&#034; and &#034;Westworld,&#034; told the Daily News Saturday he was &#034;absolutely astoundingly flabbergasted&#034; by Dushku&#039;s accusation.&#034;I don&#039;t know where this comes from. I am absolutely floored, she was a sweet kid I am absolutely in shock right now,&#034; he said, adding he was shaking because he was so upset. &#034;I don&#039;t know why she would do this to me. It is not true.&#034;",

In an Instagram post posted to her page on Feb. 1, 2018, Vee thanks fellow model Kate Upton for speaking up on sexual harassment accusations against Guess co-founder Paul Marciano, then goes on to accuse Hadid - who is the father of models Bella and Gigi Hadid - of abuse. She claims the 69-year-old invited her to his home for coffee, but abused her instead. Vee further states that, following the incident as well as another involving Marciano, the two made her sign a non-disclosure agreement and threatened to make her \&#034;disappear\&#034; if she didn&#039;t. She also provided screenshots of text messages between herself and Hadid to back up her claims. Hadid has told TMZ that \&#034;when we met it was not a date and not once did I touch her.\&#034; (Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images for Global Lyme Alliance)",

The Las Vegas icon&#039;s encounter with the manicurist reportedly led to a $7.5 million payoff. The incidents described by the employees included a wide range of inappropriate behavior: Wynn allegedly walked around his complex in extremely short shirts without underwear; often sat for pedicures in a way that exposed his genitals; repeatedly propositioned his wife&#039;s married assistant, calling her up to ask, \&#034;What are you wearing?\&#034; and \&#034;Why don&#039;t you hang out with me?\&#034;; directed his longtime assistant to track down the home phone numbers of casino cocktail waitresses, and allegedly ordered a female masseuse to massage his penis during his sessions. Wynn is blaming the allegations on his ex-wife. \&#034;The idea that I ever assaulted any woman is preposterous,\&#034; said Wynn, who built the Mirage, Bellagio and several other posh casinos.

The second anonymous allegation made by a mother three, alleges that in December 2017, Nelly invited her to his dressing room. He allegedly dropped his pants, began masturbating and kissing her while trying to remove her top without consent. (Gabe Ginsberg/Getty Images)",

Directors have different styles and some times they could be much more demanding on inexperienced actors,\&#034; Pippo said, likely addressing Schaech&#039;s claims of verbal abuse in the form of criticism. Zeffirelli is now 94. (Alessandra Benedetti/Getty Images)",

Khalighi, who was 17 at the time, said that Simmons then pulled off her clothes while Ratner was watching. \&#034;I looked over at Brett and said &#039;help me,&#039;\&#034; Khalighi told the Los Angeles Times. \&#034;And I&#039;ll never forget the look on his face, in that moment, the realization fell on me that they were in it together.\&#034; (Evan Agostini/AP)",

One actress, Jennifer Steele, claimed Jeremy, 64, raped her twice in December 1997, at a photo shoot and in his apartment. Steele was 25 and working as a dancer in a club when Jeremy invited her to his apartment to meet producers, but he then allegedly shut her in the bathroom with him and said, \&#034;&#039;I need to look at your a-- so I can get hard for the photo shoot.\&#034; Steele told Rolling Stone, \&#034;Then it turned into him basically sticking it in without me knowing it was happening. I said flat-out no. It stopped, but it didn&#039;t stop soon enough after I said no.\&#034;  Adult entertainer Danica Dane claimed Jeremy sexually assaulted her at an expo in 2014, and Jay Taylor claimed Jeremy digitally penetrated her at a convention in 2013 while her boyfriend was taking their photo. In a statement to the magazine, Jeremy threatened to sue anyone who accused him of rape and defends himself, saying, \&#034;As for the charges of Groping, I say yes, I AM A GROPER. And by groper, I mean I get paid to show up to these shows, events, and photo shoots and touch the people and they touch me.\&#034; (Ethan Miller/Getty Images)",

Perrineau, who starred in \&#034;Passengers\&#034; and the live-action version of \&#034;Jem and the Holograms,\&#034; filed a report with the Los Angeles County Sheriffâs Department on Friday, November 17, 2017, The Wrap first reported. Perrineau, the daughter of \&#034;Lost\&#034; star Harold Perrineau, said she met Miller while she was out drinking with friends at the Standard Hotel one night in 2012. She reluctantly followed when her friends stopped at his home, and, she said in her statement, \&#034;At some point, I woke up in Murray&#039;s bed naked. He was on top of me having sexual intercourse with me. I freaked out and was extremely upset and traumatized. At no time did I consent to any sexual contact with Murray.\&#034; Miller&#039;s attorney vehemently denied the accusations, and \&#034;Girls\&#034; star Lena Dunham and showrunner Jenni Konner shocked their followers when they, too, questioned Perrineau&#039;s honesty in a joint statement: \&#034;While our first instinct is to listen to every woman&#039;s story, our insider knowledge of Murray&#039;s situation makes us confident that sadly this accusation is one of the 3 percent of assault cases that are misreported every year.\&#034; (Donato Sardella/WireImage)",

Despite the writer turning him down, Wenner kept at his advances, offering Ryan a 25-story contract to stay at his townhouse during a 2005 meeting. \&#034;I had Jann Wenner&#039;s tongue in my mouth,\&#034; Ryan said. \&#034;I went along for a second but then said something to the effect of &#039;Oh please, Iâm not that kind of girl.

Afterwards, Takei invited him back to his condo for drinks. After the second one, Brunton said he began to feel dizzy and passed out for a few minutes in a beanbag chair. \&#034;The next thing I remember I was coming to and he had my pants down around my ankles and he was groping my crotch and trying to get my underwear off and feeling me up at the same time, trying to get his hands down my underwear,\&#034; Brunton said in his interview. \&#034;I came to and said, &#039;What are you doing?!&#039; I said, &#039;I don&#039;t want to do this,&#039;\&#034; and then he left the star&#039;s apartment, Brunton related.

LaRue, who appeared on eight seasons of \&#034;CSI: Miami,\&#034; accused Seagal of harassing her during an audition when she was 22. She said Seagal locked her in a room at his home in 1990 and opened his kimono to reveal he was wearing nothing but his underwear, Deadline reported.  \&#034;I go to sit on the couch and he comes towards me and he&#039;s opening his weirdo kimono. There&#039;s no script or anything. Just him standing there with his kimono open,\&#034; she said. \&#034;He had underwear on, thank God, and he was bare everywhere else. And it was clear he was not just getting cozy,\&#034; said LaRue. The actress managed to bolt out of the house. Jenny McCarthy said Seagal told her to take off her dress during an audition before he unzipped his own pants. De Rossi wrote on Twitter that Seagal told her \&#034;how important it is to have chemistry off set\&#034; as he unzipped his leather pants during an audition. And Margulies said Seagal, who was armed with a gun, told her he wanted to massage her. She managed to escape. (Allen Berezovsky/Getty Images)",

Kreisberg, who works on hit shows like \&#034;Arrow\&#034; and \&#034;Supergirl,\&#034; is accused of asking for massages from women staffers, making inappropriate comments, touching people without permission and kissing women without asking, according to a piece in Variety. He was also known for commenting frequently on women&#039;s looks and clothes and creating a toxic, sexualized atmosphere, witnesses told the magazine. While women were the most frequent targets, at least one man also said he suffered at Kreisbergs hands. The man said he was leaning over a female colleague&#039;s desk when Kreisberg came up behind him, grabbed his behind and began to pantomime having sex with him. Kreisberg allegedly laughed and said, \&#034;Well, if youre offering,\&#034; when the startled man turned around.Kreisberg denies anything improper ever took place. (Paul A. Hebert/Invision/AP)",

In an interview with Buzzfeed, Rapp says the \&#034;House of Cards\&#034; star, then-26, invited him to his Manhattan apartment in 1986, before he made unwanted sexual advances towards him in his bedroom. \&#034;He picked me up like a groom picks up the bride over the threshold. But I don&#039;t, like, squirm away initially, because I&#039;m like, &#039;What&#039;s going on?&#039; And then he lays down on top of me.\&#034; In response to the allegations, Spacey apologized to Rapp and also addressed a longstanding Hollywood rumor. \&#034;I honestly do not remember the encounter, it would have been over 30 years ago. But if I did behave as he describes, I owe him the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior â¦\&#034; Spacey says in a statement posted on his Twitter account late Sunday night. \&#034;This story has encouraged me to address other things about my life. I know that there are stories out there about me and that some have been fueled by the fact that I have been so protective of my privacy. As those closest to me know, in my life I have had relationships with both men and women,\&#034; Spacey said. \&#034;I have loved and had romantic encounters with men throughout my life, and I choose now to live as a gay man. I want to deal with this honestly and openly and that starts with examining my own behavior.\&#034; (Christopher Polk/Getty Images)",

Polanski has primarily resided there in the decades since, though an Interpol notice has existed for him since 2005. (Andreas Rentz/Getty Images)",

Kelly was indicted with 21 counts of child pornography in June of that year, and arrested in 2003 when photos of another underage girl were found on a camera in his house. While the charges were dropped against Kelly for the latter in 2004, the case for the former dragged until 2007, when a jury found him not guilty. Ten years later, in 2017, Kelly was accused of running a sex cult, another claim he stated was false. Parents of the women in the alleged cult have stated he brainwashed them.
