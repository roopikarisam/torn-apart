MAYWOOD - A teacher's aide who works in the South Hackensack School District was arrested Thursday and accused of sexually assaulting a girl, authorities said.

Phillip Cerone, 27, of Maywood was arrested one day after investigators received information about the alleged assault, according to Bergen County Prosecutor Gurbir S. Grewal.

Cerone was charged with sexual assault and two counts of endangering the welfare of a child, the prosecutor said in a statement.

According to state pension records, Cerone has worked for the South Hackensack Board of Education since Sept. 1, 2014 and earns $25,470 a year. The district serves students in kindergarten through eighth grade.

The prosecutor's office did not say whether the victim is a student in the district.

Cerone was held in the Bergen County Jail pending a court appearance.

In addition to the prosecutor's office, police in Maywood and South Hackensack assisted in the investigation, Grewal said.
