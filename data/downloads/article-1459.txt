EDINBURG — The $1 million bond for former Hidalgo County District Clerk Omar Guerrero has yet to be collected after a Tuesday morning bond forfeiture hearing was reset for late December.


County Court-at-Law No. 5 Judge Rodolfo Gonzalez reset the hearing for Dec. 27, telling attorneys for the state and bondsmen that “it needs to be resolved.”

Guerrero is believed to have fled to Mexico in 2013 after he was released from jail on bond for cocaine possession and tampering with the identification of an assault rifle.


An arrest warrant for sexual assault of a minor was subsequently issued for the disgraced clerk.

“We’re hoping somehow, some way (Guerrero) is found and arrested and brought in,” said Hidalgo County District Attorney Ricardo Rodriguez, who emphasized his office would like to proceed on the criminal cases against Guerrero.


The bond forfeiture process began in 2016 after Guerrero failed to appear for his arraignment.
