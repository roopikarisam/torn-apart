Newark police detectives arrested a 41-year-old man wanted in a shooting in the city in December, authorities said Tuesday.

William Johnson had been sought in the Dec. 12 shooting of another man on the 200 block of Renner Avenue after a dispute, Public Safety Director Anthony F. Ambrose said in a statement.

The wounded man was taken to Newark Beth Israel Hospital for treatment, police said. Johnson also shot at another person who was not injured, police said.

After developing evidence linking him to the shooting, members of the department's Fugitive Apprehension Team on Tuesday arrested Johnson on charges of aggravated assault and weapons offenses, police said.

Johnson had not yet been booked into the Essex County Correctional Facility as of late Tuesday morning, according to jail records.
