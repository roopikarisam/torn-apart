GENEVA – No one was injured after a house was damaged by fire May 12 in the 700 block of Fox Run Drive on Geneva’s east side.

The Geneva Fire Department was dispatched to a reported structure fire at approximately 1:47 p.m. after the homeowner called 911 to report a lightning strike to the roof with a possible fire on the second floor, a news release from the Geneva Fire Department stated.

As the first units arrived on the scene, heavy fire was showing from the roof. The initial response was immediately elevated to a Mutual Aid Box Alarm System, first‐level box alarm for additional manpower, equipment and resources, according to the release.

Firefighters initiated an interior attack and brought the fire under control in 45 minutes.

The preliminary cause of the fire is a lightning strike to the roof, the release stated.

The home sustained significant fire damage in the attic and smoke and water damage throughout the structure. Damage estimates still are being compiled, but the house has been deemed uninhabitable at this time.

Firefighters from Batavia, St. Charles, Elburn, West Chicago, Fermilab and the North Aurora fire departments assisted Geneva at the scene. The South Elgin and Winfield fire departments filled in the Geneva fire stations during the call.

Additional support was provided by the Geneva Emergency Management Agency, Geneva Police Department and the Geneva Electric Department.
