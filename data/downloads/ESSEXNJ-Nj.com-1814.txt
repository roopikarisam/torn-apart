Essex County sheriff's detectives in Newark on Wednesday arrested a 39-year-old man who was on the run from an aggravated assault conviction, authorities said.

After they "immediately recognized the suspect peering out of a front living room window" of the Hunterdon Street apartment where he was hiding, officers found Kenneth Durant hiding in a bathroom inside, Sheriff Armando Fountoura said in a statement.

When officers searched the apartment, Fontoura said, they found a .357-caliber Ruger revolver, along with ammunition, drug-packaging materials and $710 cash.

At the time of his arrest, authorities said, Durant was wanted for sentencing on previous aggravated assault and weapons convictions.

He now faces additional charges of possessing a weapon as a previously convicted felon, unlawfully possessing a weapon and possessing narcotics paraphernalia, according to the sheriff's office.

Durant was expected to be booked in the Essex County Correctional Facility after processing.
