Three Elgin residents have been sentenced to prison after pleading guilty to kidnapping, beating and burning a 19-year-old woman, the Kane County State's Attorney's Office said.


Ruby Gomez, 22, of the 100 block of South Clifton Avenue; Gino Moraca, 26, of the 300 block of Raymond Street; and Kassandra Delgado, 22, of the 200 block of McClure Avenue; agreed to prison terms in exchange for reduced charges in connection with a February 2016 incident in which a woman was beaten in her Elgin home, taken to Moraca's apartment and restrained, beaten and burned with cigarettes, a state's attorney's office news release said.


Gomez and Delgado pleaded guilty to a charge of home invasion, a class X felony. Gomez was sentenced to 10 years in the Illinois Department of Corrections and Delgado received a 9-year term, the release said.


Moraca pleaded guilty to unlawful restraint, a class 4 felony, and will serve two years in prison, the release said.


The original charges included felony counts of aggravated kidnapping-inflicting great bodily harm, aggravated battery caustic substance and aggravated battery-torture.


Those charges are still pending against Megan A. Lino, 19, of the 600 block of Jefferson Avenue in Carpentersville, and Luis M. Palomar, 18, of the 0-100 block of Clark Avenue, Lake in The Hills.


The victim told police she was with Moraca, a former boyfriend, when four women entered her home and, with the help of Moraca, forced her to leave and beat her in a car and again at Moraca's apartment.


A female juvenile also pleaded guilty in the case but no information on a sentence was released because of her age.
