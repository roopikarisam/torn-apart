An Elgin man was arrested on drug and weapon charges Thursday after the police raided his home and found cannabis, hand guns and 480 rounds of ammunition, Elgin police said.


A search warrant for Charles Young’s house in the 300 block of Dundee Avenue was obtained following a month-long investigation triggered by complaints that drugs were being sold from the residence, the Elgin Police Department said in a news release.


The department’s SWAT team, assisted by its special investigations division, executed the warrant about 4 p.m.and found an undisclosed amount of cannabis, items used for drug sales, two guns and ammunition, the release said.


Young, 25, was charged with felony counts of possession of cannabis with intent to deliver and possession of cannabis.


“We hope that the message is being delivered that we will not ignore illegal drug activity in our community,” Interim Police Chief Bill Wolf said in the release. “We strive to address concerns of drug activity brought forward by citizens and encourage our residents to keep providing drug tip information to us.”
