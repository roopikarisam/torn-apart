Scottsdale resident Bart James Ellis, 44, was sentenced Monday to two years in prison and ordered to pay almost $1 million in restitution for an investment scheme, the Internal Revenue Service announced.


The sentence was handed down by U.S. District Judge Douglas L. Rayes.

Ellis previously pleaded guilty to money laundering in the case.


From 2012 through 2015, Ellis, a former financial adviser, solicited more than $1.1 million from former clients, including former major-league pitcher, Cy Young winner and Chicago White Sox television commentator Steve Stone.


Ellis said the money would be used for investments, but an investigation found he had spent much of it on himself and lost the rest on risky stock trades.

“The defendant misled his clients and stole their hard-earned money,” said IRS Criminal Investigation Special Agent in Charge Ismael Nevarez Jr., who is in the department that conducted the investigation.


Prosecution was handled by Mark Kokanovich, assistant U.S. attorney for Arizona.


“The United States Attorney’s Office takes this kind of criminal conduct very seriously and will continue to aggressively prosecute financial frauds,” Acting U.S. Attorney Elizabeth A. Strange said in a news release.
