30-year-old Jaclyn Truman was arrested and charged with two counts of lewd acts on a minor.

A Seminole County teacher was in jail Friday after deputies said she had a sexual relationship with a student.


A 15-year-old girl told another adult she had a relationship with Jaclyn Truman, 30, said Bob Kealing, Seminole County Sheriff’s Office spokesman.


The girl told deputies the relationship lasted two months last year, according to an arrest report. The student and Truman engaged in sexual activity multiple times at Hagerty High School, the girl said, according to the report.


Seminole County Public Schools received a report Oct. 2 from Child Protective Services about the allegations and Truman was placed on paid administrative leave the same day, district spokesman Michael Lawrence said.


At the time of the report, Truman was a sign language teacher at Lake Howell High School, Lawrence said. Last year, Truman was a substitute teacher at Hagerty High School.


She submitted a letter of resignation Sept. 27 to be effective Oct. 20, Lawrence said. The resignation became effective and final Thursday.


On Thursday, Truman also turned herself in and is cooperating with law enforcement, Kealing said. She is charged with two counts of lewd acts on a minor and is jailed in lieu of $40,000 bail.


Truman started working for Seminole County Public Schools in 2005 as an instructional assistant at Lyman High School. In 2008, she became a teacher there where she worked until 2013. She resigned to take a job as Coordinator for Mentored and Pastoral Counseling at Asbury Theological Seminary, Lawrence said.


In 2015, Truman returned to the district as a substitute teacher. This fall she became a part-time teacher at Lake Howell High School.


The school district performed standard background checks on Truman before she was hired as a full-time teacher, Lawrence said. She had a clean record.
