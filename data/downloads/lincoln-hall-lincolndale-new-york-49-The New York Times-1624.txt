Good morning on this drizzly Tuesday.


You’re not waking up to any snow, as forecasts originally predicted, but light rain and temperatures in the 30s this morning may make your commute gloomy.


Any early showers are expected to make way for a cloudy but manageable afternoon, with the high climbing near 50.


The weather may exacerbate your winter fatigue — on this day last year, the mercury reached 74 — but it could be worse: In 1977, it snowed in New York City on May 9.


What is unusual is the cold weather. “It’s just lasted so long,” said Joe Pollina, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, who pointed out that after an “extremely warm” February, March was 2.4 degrees colder than normal and April 5.4 degrees.

The silver lining: The low temperatures will keep pollen under wraps for a little longer, according to Guy Robinson, a senior lecturer at Fordham University who compiles Manhattan’s pollen data for the National Allergy Bureau.


“It will slow things down,” Mr. Robinson told us. “Flowers are open, but they’re not opening at the rate that they would be if it were 50-plus degrees out.”


But that could mean that a stretch with high pollen levels looms around the corner.


“It will only hold a lid on it for so long,” Mr. Robinson said of the cold. “And what we’ve seen in past years, when we’ve had this sort of pattern of weather, is that you’ll then get these sustained high levels of pollen for several days in a row.”


The small amounts of cypress and elm tree pollen in the air now will soon be joined by particles from birch, oak, ash and beech, Mr. Robinson said. And when that happens, according to his research from 2016, you may feel it most in Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island.

It’s Equal Pay Day.


Started in 1996 by the National Committee on Pay Equity, Equal Pay Day is an effort to raise awareness about the gender wage gap.


On average, women in the United States earn 80 cents for every dollar earned by men. In New York, which has the narrowest pay gap of any state, women make 89 cents for every dollar men make.


(A 2016 study commissioned by Public Advocate Letitia James found that New York City women were collectively paid $6 billion less than men each year, while women across New York State earned about $20 billion less.)

A law barring employers from asking potential hires about their salary history, intended to reduce pay inequities for women and minority workers, took effect in New York City in the fall. And state leaders are exploring ways to address this issue through legislation in the coming months.


New Yorkers — among them union workers, labor activists, the public advocate and Lt. Gov. Kathy Hochul — are gathering at City Hall at noon to raise awareness about the issues in New York and demand pay equity.
