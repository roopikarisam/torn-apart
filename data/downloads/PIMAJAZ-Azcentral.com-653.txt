A Pima County inmate died after being found "unresponsive" in his jail cell early Sunday, according to the Pima County Sheriff's Department.


Brian Ferry, 47, was found in his cell at the Pima County Adult Detention Complex at about 1:30 a.m. Jail staff administered aid until paramedics arrived, officials said.


Medical personnel declared Ferry dead at the scene. Detectives from the Sheriff’s Department determined the death was a suicide. 


Ferry was awaiting sentencing for the 2002 murders of Charles Russell and Catherine Nelson. 


Police said the couple traveled from Phoenix to Tucson to buy a motorcycle from Ferry and never returned home. The case went unsolved for more than a decade until Ferry was arrested in 2015.


A jury found Ferry guilty of the double homicide in May. He was scheduled for sentencing July 23.
