SACRAMENTO — Denver Nuggets starting power forward Paul Millsap is out for Monday’s game at the Sacramento Kings, according to the team’s most recent injury report.

Millsap, who is Denver’s second-leading scorer (15.3 points per game) and rebounder (6.2 per game), sustained the injury during the first half of Sunday’s loss at the Los Angeles Lakers. He went to the locker room and returned briefly, before sitting out the second half. After the game, Denver coach Michael Malone said Millsap had undergone an X-ray but that he was still awaiting results.

Nuggets starting small forward Wilson Chandler is also listed as questionable with lower back pain, which could make Denver’s starting lineup and big-man rotation interesting against the Kings. Chandler is averaging 9.4 points, 4.5 rebounds and 2.7 assists per game but has reached double figures in four consecutive games.

Mason Plumlee is typically the Nuggets’ first inside player off the bench, though Malone also likes pairing Kenneth Faried alongside star center Nikola Jokic. Juancho Hernangomez, who on Sunday night got his first extensive minutes since recovering from mononucleosis, Trey Lyles and Richard Jefferson are also options at forward, as is versatile piece Will Barton.

The Nuggets did not hold a shootaround prior to Monday’s game against the Kings, which is standard procedure on the second day of a back-to-back set. Malone will be available to the media approximately 90 minutes prior to Monday’s tipoff.
