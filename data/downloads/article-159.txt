State police say a 24-year-old Southern Oregon man will be charged with murder after authorities discovered a dead body on the scene of a trailer fire.

Troy Dawson, of Murphy, was arrested Saturday morning, a day after emergency responders were called to a fire in Murphy, an unincorporated community in Josephine County southeast of Grants Pass.

Officials found a fifth-wheel trailer engulfed in flames at the property, located along Board Shanty Creek Road, according to Rural Metro Fire.

State police have not disclosed where the victim's body was located or any other details about what happened. The victim's name has also not been released. 

The fire spread to grass nearby, but was contained and did not reach neighboring buildings.

Officers named Dawson as a person of interest and issued a public bulletin to help find him. They cautioned that he may be armed with a gun. 

Witnesses called in to say they saw him 2 1/2 miles away from the scene, according to Oregon State Police. 

Dawson was booked into the Josephine County jail on one count of first-degree murder and one count of arson.
