Nations was driving a red Chevrolet Prizm with expired Indiana license plates, a car matching the description of a suspect vehicle in public menacing complaints — the mountain biker threats  near Mount Herman Road, west of Monument.

The body of mountain biker Timothy Watkins was found Sept. 17 in the same area. He had been shot. Watkins’ death is being investigated as a homicide.
