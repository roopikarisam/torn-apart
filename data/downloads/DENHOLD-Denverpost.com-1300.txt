East assistant coach David Carey talks to his players ahead of their game against the Smoky Hill Buffaloes before the first half of their class 5A round of 16 game on Wednesday, Feb. 28, 2018.




With the way Smoky Hill played in its wire-to-wire 76-72 victory over Denver East in the Class 5A Sweet 16 on Wednesday, it’s hard to believe the Buffaloes lost seven games this season, including four in-state setbacks.

In the victory at the Thunderdome, Smoky Hill flashed the up-tempo, athletic brand of basketball that’s been building under coach Anthony Hardin for the past three seasons — and signaled to the state that despite regular season stumbles and a lowly 13 seed, these Buffaloes are ready to fulfill the potential of a first state championship.

“We’ve been tested all season — we’ve tested each other, we’ve been tested on the court, tested off the court,” senior forward John Harge said. “When you go through adversity you either break or you bond, and we bonded, and I think that showed when the game got close tonight.”

Smoky Hill opened the evening on a 8-0 run in front of a slow-to-arrive crowd, prompting Denver East coach Rudy Carey to call a timeout to stop the bleeding.

Whatever Carey said, it at least provided an initial spark in his team, as the Angels battled back-and-forth in a transition-heavy first half.

But it was Smoky Hill that would make a decisive set of plays to give the Buffaloes a burst of momentum leading into the locker room in a rematch of the Angels’ Sweet 16 win last year.

First, sophomore point guard Quinten Rock — who led all scorers with 29 points — tossed an alley-opp to senior forward Will Becker as he drove through the lane with under ten seconds to play in the second quarter.

“Quinten just continues to evolve as a point guard, and he’s gotten better each time out on the court this season,” Harge noted. “He helps us in all aspects of the game, from rebounding to obviously passing, and he’s a guy behind a lot of the big plays inside.”

Rock’s toss to Becker, in conjunction with senior forward Kyle Cabs drawing a charge on the other end of the floor with a few ticks left, brought the house down with jeers and cheers on both sides while extending the Buffaloes’ lead to 41-28.

The plays also sparked a shouting match between Carey and Smoky Hill fans, a feud that continued into the second half as tension on the court rose and the Angels stormed back, full-court pressing and cutting the lead to six to begin the fourth.

In the final quarter, Denver East continued to fight, and by 4:44 to play the Angels had made it a one-possession game, 65-62, for the first time since the opening frame.

But the Buffaloes gave themselves just enough of a buffer to hold off the late charge by Denver East, which was paced by 23 points from senior guard Daylen Kountz and 20 more from junior guard Kwane Marble.

Smoky Hill (18-7), which also got 16 points from Becker and 12 from junior guard Kenny Foster, takes on George Washington in the Great 8 at the Denver Coliseum on Saturday. The No. 4 Angels finish 21-4.
