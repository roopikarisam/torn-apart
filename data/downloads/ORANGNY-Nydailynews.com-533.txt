A homeless man allegedly found naked and masturbating in the closet of a nursery in a Florida home has been arrested.

Kevin Jones, 36, lurked in the closet just feet away from a young mother preparing her 3-month-old baby for day care earlier this week, WFLA reported.

The woman, who did not want to be identified, screamed when she opened the closet door and then blocked the intruder's escape route. Her fiance ran to her aid and Jones quickly put his hands in the air and told him he was homeless, according to the arrest report.

The father admitted to striking the suspect in an effort to protect his young daughter and 2-year-old son, according to the news station.

When Jones refused to leave, the fiance went off in search of a knife — but the suspect ran for the garage and then jumped the fence surrounding the property.

Authorities found him nearby and he was arrested. They charged him with burglary of an occupied conveyance, burglary or an occupied dwelling, exposure of sexual organs and two counts of lewd and lascivious exhibition.

Jones has denied masturbating inside the home.

Deputies said he began touching himself and exposed himself by lowering his pants during an interview at the sheriff's office. He told deputies he did not remember how he got into the home.

The family had only just moved into the Orlando residence on Christmas Eve, a few days before they found Jones in their infant's closet.

"To be in my baby's nursery and to find something so horrific and experience that," the woman told the Atlanta Constitution Journal. "We just feel stripped of our safety, our sense of security. The innocence of what should be a serene room in our home."

The family said they were not sure how Jones got into their house or how long he'd been there.

"I don't know if he watched us as we slept," the mother said.

Jones was being held without bond at the Orange County Jail.
