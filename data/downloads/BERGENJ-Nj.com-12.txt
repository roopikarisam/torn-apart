A Union City man was arrested in North Bergen on Saturday where police say he was driving a car reported stolen in Weehawken a few days earlier.

Jerry Serrano, of Bergen Turnpike, was charged with receiving stolen property regarding the 2016 Acura reported stolen on April 9, the criminal complaint says.

Serrano made his first appearance on the charge Monday in Criminal Justice Reform Court in Jersey City via video link from Hudson County jail in Kearny.

The state moved to detain him throughout prosecution. A detention hearing is set for tomorrow before Hudson County Superior Court Judge Paul DePascale in the Hudson County Administration Building in Jersey City.
