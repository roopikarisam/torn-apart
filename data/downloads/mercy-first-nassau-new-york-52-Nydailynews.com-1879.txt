Nick Cannon is still laughing days after his performance at a small New Jersey university.

The comedian was hired to perform at Georgian Court University in Lakewood, N.J. — a private Roman Catholic school — and signed a contract requiring him to "avoid vulgarity and explicit sexual content in his performance."

"Unfortunately, he repeatedly chose to ignore this request," the university's president, Dr. Joseph R. Marbach, said in a statement to the Daily News on Thursday.

After the Sept. 20 performance, Marbach sent a letter to the GCU community apologizing for the "America's Got Talent" host's behavior — and asking him for an apology, but Cannon wasn't so sorry.

"I ain't apologizing for s--t LOL… wait, I'm sorry your university doesn't believe in freedom of speech!!!" the star wrote on Twitter Tuesday, along with a copy of the email sent out by Marbach.

A spokesperson for GCU confirmed the letter's authenticity to the Daily News. It echoed the university's "profound disappointment" in Cannon's portion of the comedy showcase.

The letter stated: "While comedy often explores serious social issues in ways that are fun and thought-provoking, Mr. Cannon's act crossed the line. His words were offensives and do not represent our Mercy core values."

Marbach wrote that they anticipated that the university would get the "NBC or MTV version of Mr. Cannon."

"We did not," he said. "That was unfortunate."

The event took place during the school's reunion weekend at Lakewood's Strand Theatre, which was attended by both new students and many alumni.

Georgian Court University was established in 1908 as a women's college, but became fully coeducational in 2013.

This past May, the university graduated its first ever fully co-ed class.

From 1908 to 2013, the university was headed by the Sisters of Mercy nuns.
