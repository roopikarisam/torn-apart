A woman who had been jailed in Douglas County and charged with trespassing died Thursday in her cell, authorities said.

Susan D. Kiscoan, 46, had been in jail for two weeks when her body was found on her bunk in a single-person cell, according to the Douglas County Department of Corrections. Jail staff discovered her, unresponsive, at 4:21 a.m. Thursday.

Kiscoan was booked about 4:45 p.m. Sept. 14. Police and the Omaha City Prosecutor’s Office had accused her of trespassing that day at a CHI Health clinic.

She pleaded not guilty at a court hearing the next day. A judge set her bail at $2,500, meaning she could pay 10 percent of that, $250, to be released from the jail.

The cause of her death was not available. The Douglas County Sheriff’s Office has begun an investigation, as required by state law for in-custody deaths.
