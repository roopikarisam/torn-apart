A Jersey City man was knocked out cold and had his jaw broken following an argument with his 49-year-old brother on Sunday, officials said.

Anthony Mearite, of the 300 block of Old Bergen Road, was charged with aggravated assault after the incident that resulted in his brother's jaw being broken in three places, the criminal complaint says.

The complaint says a surgeon used a titanium plate and three screws to mend the victim's jaw.

Mearite made his first appearance on the charges on Monday in Criminal Justice Reform Court in Jersey City via video link from Hudson County jail in Kearny.

At the hearing, the state moved to detain him though the course of his prosecution. A detention hearing is scheduled for today.
