To the Editor:


Bravo to the Cincinnati Symphony, and the local government that supported most of the cost, for their successful hall project (Arts pages, Oct. 18). Kudos for good all-around planning!


But is it fair for your online headline to say the David Geffen Hall project “stumbles”?


In fact, your insightful article makes the point that there is a positive and achievable pathway forward that invests resources to achieve real impact.


With our partners at Lincoln Center, the New York Philharmonic has made a strong decision for our community and institutions to embrace that vision. Stay tuned!
