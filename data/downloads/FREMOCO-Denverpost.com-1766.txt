COLORADO SPRINGS — Attorneys for the family of a man who died in the Fremont County jail say inmates were abruptly cut off from certain prescription drugs in spite of policies against such actions.

The Gazette of Colorado Springs reports the allegations were made in a lawsuit over the death of 53-year-old John Patrick Walter. Walter died in custody in 2014 after being booked on suspicion of felony assault.

Attorneys for Walter’s estate say he’d been taking an antianxiety drug for years with a doctor’s permission.

But they say staff at the jail followed an unwritten policy to immediately discontinue inmates’ prescriptions even though such actions could be dangerous.

The lawsuit accuses guards of injuring Walter while trying to restrain him as he went through withdrawal.
