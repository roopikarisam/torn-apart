WICHITA, Kan. (AP) â€” Both suspects in the shooting of a loss prevention officer at a Wichita Menards store are in custody.

Police spokesman Charley Davidson said an 18-year-old male was arrested Wednesday in Hays. Details of the arrest were not immediately released.

A 17-year-old girl was arrested Tuesday after crashing a stolen Mercedes in Derby.

Police began searching for them after the employee was shot Monday in northwest Wichita. Investigators say the employee confronted the two after seeing them leave the store without paying for a home security system. At some point, the male allegedly drew a gun and shot him.

The employee was treated and released at a Wichita hospital.

The female suspect was hospitalized Tuesday and later booked into a juvenile detention center on possible charges of aggravated battery, auto theft and fleeing.
