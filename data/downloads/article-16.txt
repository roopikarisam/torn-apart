Adam Levine is cleaning house.

Fresh off of listing his Bel-Air home for sale at $18.9 million, the Maroon 5 frontman has put another home in on the Westside of Los Angeles back on the market for $15.9 million.

The contemporary-style in Beverly Crest was previously on the market last year for as much as $17.5 million, records show.

Built in 1940 and recently renovated, the single-story home has 7,100 square feet of interior that includes an expansive great room, a media room, a den/library and a gym/spa. Vaulted ceilings and walls of windows brighten the common areas, which open to landscaped grounds and canyon views.

Stone patios, a swimming pool and spa and a lighted basketball court fill out the backyard. Elsewhere on the roughly 3.6-acre property is a two-story garage with a hydraulic lift and a speakeasy-style card room.

Levine bought the house through a trust five years ago for $4.83 million, records show.

Kurt Rappaport of Westside Estate Agency holds the listing.

Levine, 38, is best known as the lead vocalist and guitarist for Maroon 5. The Grammy-winning pop-rock band has hits that include "She Will Be Loved," "This Love" and "Moves Like Jagger."

Since 2010 he has appeared as a judge on the singing-competition series "The Voice."
