Good morning on this mild Wednesday.


New York continues to mourn the victims of the attack in Las Vegas, one of the deadliest mass shootings in U.S. history.


A vigil was held at New York University on Monday, and another at Brooklyn Borough Hall last night, for those killed in Las Vegas and other victims of gun violence.


As more details emerge about the Las Vegas shooting and the  gunman who carried it out, we wanted to know how gun laws in our city and state compare to those in Nevada, and other areas of the country.


“New York State, as a whole, has stronger gun safety laws than the rest of the country,” said Adam Skaggs, chief counsel for the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. “It’s also one of a handful of states that allows cities to have their own gun laws.”

How do New York’s gun laws differ from other states?


In New York, you must obtain a permit and pass a rigorous background check for all gun purchases. In most states, buying a gun from a private seller — in a classified ad or online — does not require a permit or passing a background check, Mr. Skaggs said. In New York, even if you meet the requirements to purchase a gun, law enforcement may still deny you. Also, if your gun is lost or stolen, you are required to report it to the police.


What are the state’s rules for owning assault weapons?


Under the 2013 Safe Act, passed after the 2012 mass murder at Sandy Hook Elementary School, New York prohibits the purchase or possession of large-capacity magazines and assault-style weapons (unless you owned the gun before January 2013). Other semiautomatic weapons, in which the trigger must be pulled to fire each bullet, are legal in New York, but you cannot legally purchase a magazine that holds more than 10 rounds. In Nevada, and much of the country, Mr. Skaggs said, magazine capacities are not regulated.


Are the laws in New York City different than the state?


Yes. The city’s permitting and licensing requirements “are among the strongest in the country,” Mr. Skaggs said. New York City has its own regulations, which include filing a 17-page handgun license application form, along with a host of documents in person. The Police Department interviews all applicants. The safe-storage requirement in the city is stricter than the state: All guns in the city must be secured with a safety-locking device when not in use.


How many handgun licenses are there in New York City?


In New York City, 41,162 people have licenses to possess firearms, according to the Police Department. Around 22,500 of these licenses are issued to security guards, or to individuals who have handguns in their businesses or homes. Aside from retired law enforcement officers, there are fewer than 2,500 people who have full carry permits, which allow them to carry a handgun around the city anywhere they are permitted.

Here’s what else is happening:


Not much to say about today’s weather, other than it’s looking pretty dang good.


Look up and you’ll see a crystalline sky and lots o’ sunshine.

A heads-up for architecture geeks, lookie-loos and design fiends.


Open House New York, the popular event that gives New Yorkers a behind-the-scenes look at some of our most important buildings, is fast approaching.


The event is next weekend, but a list of participating sites will be revealed to the public today.


And we suggest you take a look early.


While you can stop by many of the more than 200 buildings and projects for free, some of the more exclusive tours and events require advance registration (and a $5 fee), and they often sell out quickly.


Tickets go on sale tomorrow at 11 a.m.


Along with past participants like the Little Red Lighthouse in Washington Heights, Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx and the Hindu Temple Society of North America in Flushing, Queens, new additions this year include: the Bridge at Cornell Tech, a recently completed research and development incubator on Roosevelt Island; a secret archway gymnasium housed in a former barracks at Liggett Hall on Governors Island; and the archives of the New York Transit Museum.
