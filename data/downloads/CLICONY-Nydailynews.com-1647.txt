A female prison worker has been busted for having sexual contact with an inmate at the upstate penitentiary where a lovestruck employee aided the high-profile escape of two killers.

Denise Prell, 38, was caught getting it on behind the imposing walls of the Clinton Correctional Facility two years after prison seamstress Joyce Mitchell aided the "Shawshank Redemption"-style breakout of Richard Matt and David Sweat.

The probe of Prell began after a corrections officer witnessed "inappropriate behavior" between the civilian employee and an inmate, authorities said.

Prell was fired soon after, and the investigation turned up evidence indicating that she was also smuggling banned items into the prison, authorities said.

She was arraigned Wednesday on multiple charges including sexual abuse and promoting prison contraband.

The married Prell is being held in the county jail on $10,000 cash bail.

The 53-year-old Mitchell played a pivotal role in the 2015 prison escape that riveted the nation and rattled residents in upstate New York.

She supplied the pair with a drill bit and hacksaws smuggled into the prison in frozen hamburger meat.

Matt and Sweat used the tools to cut holes in their cells and hack through underground pipes before escaping the prison grounds through a manhole.

The crafty cons managed to elude an army of police officers for three weeks before Matt was killed by a border agent. Sweat was wounded by a state trooper and captured two days later just a few miles from the Canadian border.

The married Mitchell had carried on a sexual relationship with Sweat in the months before the prison break.

She wept as a judge sentenced her to seven years in prison in Sept. 2015.

Mitchell was denied parole in February.

"You present yourself more as a victim than a responsible participant and appear to be emotionally unstable and easily manipulated," the board wrote.
