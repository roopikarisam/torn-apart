WESLACO — Undercover investigators with the Hidalgo County Sheriff’s Office executed a search warrant Tuesday at 6308 N. Mile 6 West Road in Weslaco and discovered more than 80 eight-liner gambling machines, also known as maquinitas.


As part of the sting, investigators played the machines and received cash payouts. More than 30 patrons were in the establishment at the time, according to the criminal complaints charging five people with engaging in organized criminal activity, possession of gambling devices, gambling promotion and keeping a gambling place.

Those charged include Christopher Escobar of Elsa, Juan Rojas-Garza of Rio Grande City, Bernardino Cruz-Castan of Reynosa, Alec Orozco of Edinburg and Jimmy Eduard Cuellar of Donna.


All five remained in the Hidalgo County jail as of press time. Justice of the Peace Gilberto Saenz set a $15,000 bond for engaging in organized criminal activity, and $5,000 bonds for each of the remaining charges — all of which are Class A misdemeanors.

If convicted, the men could face one year in jail and/or a fine amounting to no more than $4,000.
