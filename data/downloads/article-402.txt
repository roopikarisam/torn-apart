A man accused by authorities of helping his Florida girlfriend commit suicide in Cass County, Nebraska, has had his bail reduced.

Matthew Stubbendieck, 41, of Weeping Water must now post 10 percent of $20,000 bail to get out of jail.

That is down from the $50,000 set by County Court Judge John F. Steinheider on Oct. 17. Stubbendieck and his attorney immediately requested a review. Steinheider’s order, filed Tuesday, says he considered a number of factors, including the safety of others and Stubbendieck’s finances.

Stubbendieck is charged with assisting suicide in the death of Alicia Wilemon-Sullivan, 38. Authorities say he helped her take her life in early August. He told investigators she believed she had cancer.

Stubbendieck remained in the Cass County Jail early Thursday evening.
