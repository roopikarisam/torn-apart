	SAN DIEGO — Actor James Cromwell has been charged with trespassing for interrupting and denouncing an orca show at SeaWorld in San Diego.


	The San Diego Union-Tribune reported Monday that the misdemeanor charge could mean 90 days in jail or a fine up to $400.


	Cromwell, who was nominated for an Oscar for his role as the farmer in "Babe," has previously said he would serve jail time rather than pay fines. A late message left for his representatives wasn't immediately returned.


	He was wearing a "SeaWorld Sucks" T-shirt when he and six other activists stood up in front of the "Orca Encounter" show at SeaWorld on July 24.


	The 77-year-old was taken away in handcuffs after screaming, "They are suffering, and you have to know that.”


	Cromwell told park visitors through a megaphone that SeaWorld was condemning the orcas to premature deaths. The protesters were forcibly removed by security.


	A week before Cromwell’s Seaworld protest, he completed a one-week sentence at the Orange County Jail in upstate New York.
