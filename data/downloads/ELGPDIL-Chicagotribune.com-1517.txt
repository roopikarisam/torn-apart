The family of Decynthia Clements has filed a federal lawsuit against the city of Elgin charging police were unjustified in shooting the woman to death March 12 in an incident on Interstate 90.


The case was announced at a news conference Wednesday morning by attorneys Andrew Stroth and Antonio Romanucci, representing the law firms Action Injury Law Group and Romanucci &amp; Blandin, which jointly filed the case. Lt. Christian Jensen, the officer who shot Clements, and the 10 officers at the scene also were listed as defendants.


The shooting was wrongful and unnecessary, Stroth said, because “Decynthia was obeying (police) commands to exit” her vehicle and officers were aware she was mentally ill. Beyond that, Jensen has a “history of racial profiling and excessive force,” and was the only officer to fire his gun during the incident, Stroth said.


Clements, 34, of Elgin, was stopped by Elgin police on westbound Interstate 90 shortly after midnight March 12 but refused to come out of her SUV, police reports said. Officers attempted to persuade her to exit the vehicle for more than an hour before she set the SUV on fire and it filled with smoke, reports said. When she finally emerged, she was holding a knife, prompting Jensen to shoot, police said.


Clements was shot twice in the head and once in the chest, the Cook County Medical Examiner’s Office said.


“(Clements) was not posing any threat to any of the officers at that time,” Romanucci said. “The officers calculated a plan to get her out of her car and that calculated plan included Decynthia coming out of the car potentially with a knife. They were aware that she had a weapon inside of her car, which (was) nothing more than a kitchen knife.”


The lawsuit quotes from the body and dash camera video, released by Elgin police on March 22, in which the officers talked about de-escalating the situation, protecting themselves with shields and using non-lethal force, including tasers, rubber bullets and pepper bullets — — all factors that indicate shooting her was unnecessary, the suit said.


Decynthia Clements, 34, was killed by Elgin police on March 12, 2018.

According to the case, Clements was diagnosed as being schizophrenic, bipolar and having anxiety issues. Jensen, having had contact with the family at least three times previously, was aware of her condition, the suit said, and other officers at the scene were informed of her mental health issues after making contact with people who knew of her condition.

The suit also notes that, according to the video, officers at various times said, “We are just gonna go up and talk with her, see if we can get her out,” “We will try to get her to stop. At worst we have the 40 (rubber bullets) and the barrier, which is great,” and “That’s why we have pepper ball.”


“Everybody followed the plan except one officer, and that is (Christian) Jensen,” Romanucci said. “That is the officer who has a history of excessive force in his past,”


Jensen has been the subject of six complaints in his 19 years with the department — including claims of racial profiling and excessive force — but each was investigated by the city and he was cleared in all of them, according to city documents. He has also received 22 commendations and more than 70 letters of appreciation, documents show.


The lawsuit is being filed now, instead of waiting until the Illinois State Police have announced the results of their investigation into the shooting, because federal law allows them to issue subpoenas for evidence without having to wait for the probe to be completed, Stroth said.


The state police have not said when they expect their investigation to be finished.


Elgin spokeswoman Molly Center, speaking in an email, said city officials had not seen the lawsuit and “will provide further comment when the time is appropriate.”


“The city understands and respects the Clements family’s need for answers and asks for patience while the state police completes its investigation and the Cook County state’s attorney conducts its review,” Center said


The suit seeks compensatory damages in excess of $75,000 to cover medical and funeral expenses, attorneys fees and punitive damages “and for any further relief that this court deems fair and just.”
