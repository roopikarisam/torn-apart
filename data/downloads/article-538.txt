An Altamonte Springs woman is facing attempted-homicide charges after police say she sprayed gasoline on her ex-boyfriend and set him on fire Easter Sunday.


Police say Shivon Perez, 38, asked her ex-boyfriend to fix a leaking pipe in her bathroom while he was over for Easter dinner. While the man — who police haven’t identified — was fixing the pipe, he told police he noticed Perez holding a container.


When he asked Perez what was inside the container, she responded, “It’s gasoline, you son of a [expletive],” according to a police report.


Perez began spraying the man with the gasoline while saying, “you are going to pay,” police said.


The ex-boyfriend soon noticed he was on fire and began taking his clothes off and trying to extinguish the flames. He noticed Perez was locking the front door to prevent him from leaving the burning apartment while spraying fluid on the living room floor, authorities said.


The victim, who was severely burned on his face, chest, neck, arm and hand, was taken to Orlando Regional Medical Center, police said.


Before firefighters arrived to the apartment on the 300 block of Lakepointe Drive, Perez ran back inside to save her dog. She suffered from smoke inhalation and had to be intubated and sedated at Orlando Regional Medical Center, police said.


Perez faces charges of attempted homicide, arson and kidnapping. She’s being held at the Orange County jail without bond.
