HIDALGO — U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers arrested a U.S. citizen Monday attempting to enter Texas with more than 2 pounds of cocaine concealed on her body.


Officers at the Hidalgo-Reynosa International Bridge arrested the 23-year-old woman after she was referred to further inspection while walking across the bridge from Reynosa.

Officers discovered she was carrying a package amounting to 2.56 pounds of cocaine, which has an estimated street value of nearly $20,000, according to a CBP press release. The package was strapped around her right thigh, notes the criminal complaint.


During an interview with Homeland Security Investigations, the woman stated she was to be paid $500 for smuggling the drugs into the U.S.

Currently held in the East Hidalgo Detention Center, she will have her first hearing Friday in federal court.
