The king of Park Hill may soon hold court inside the crown jewel of Five Points.

Palisade Partners, owner of the storied but dormant Rossonian Hotel, unveiled its plans Monday to re-open the historic building as a 41-room boutique hotel complemented by a basement jazz club and ground-floor restaurant and lounge. The eatery/bar/venue will be named Chauncey’s for Denver basketball legend and project partner Chauncey Billups.

“We’re really excited. He’s a hometown hero. One of his passions has been to continue to contribute to the neighborhood,” Palisade president Paul Books said of Billups, whose hardwood exploits include a star-studded career at George Washington High School and the University of Colorado and two stints with the Denver Nuggets.

Billups appeared a project unveiling at the Blair-Caldwell African American Research Library in Five Points Monday night.

He referenced the neighborhood’s changing racial demographics in his comments.
