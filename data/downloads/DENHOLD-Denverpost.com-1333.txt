You have probably been too busy collecting beads, eating a LOT and drinking more to even care what Mardi Gras (literally, “Fat Tuesday”) is: a feast before the fast that is Lent, beginning on Ash Wednesday (this year falling on Feb. 14, so be prepared to skip that creme brulee on Valentine’s Day, lovers).
