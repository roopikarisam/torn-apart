The father of three Michigan children who vanished seven years ago said in a prison interview that remains found recently in Montana are "not my boys."

Andrew, Alexander and Tanner Skelton disappeared from their Morenci home on Nov. 26, 2010, and investigators believe they were likely killed by their dad.

John Skelton has claimed in the past that he gave the kids to an "underground sanctuary group" to keep them out of harm's way, but said he did not know where they are. He alleged that the boys' mother was abusive, but she denied the accusation.

During an exclusive interview with WDIV, an emotional Skelton said, "I miss their voices."

He also reiterated his claim this week that he made arrangements with an "underground sanctuary" as a safe haven for the children.

Skelton was sentenced to up to 15 years for unlawful imprisonment, but investigators could not prove more serious charges.

A box of bones and teeth were found in a Montana home in December, and experts say they belonged to children ages 2-4, 5-8 and 6-10 years old at the time of their deaths, according to NBC in Montana.

Andrew was 9 when he disappeared, Alexander was 7, and Tanner was 5.

Skelton said that when other inmates heard about what was found in Montana, they called him a child killer and threatened him.

"When I saw it on the news I just rolled my eyes," John Skelton told WDIV. "Yeah, those are not my boys."
