Lakers guard Kentavious Caldwell-Pope is serving a jail sentence while still playing basketball.

Caldwell-Pope is serving a 25-day jail sentence after he violated his probation, the Los Angeles Times reported. The 24-year-old is completing his sentence at the Seal Beach Police Department Detention Center in Orange County, California, but is allowed to participate in Lakers practices and games in California. He is not allowed to play in games outside the state.

He wears a GPS monitor while he’s away from the jail and has to submit a breath test when he returns from games or practices.

The probation stems from an incident during Caldwell-Pope’s tenure with the Pistons when he pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of allowing someone to drive his vehicle while under the influence. That resulted in a 12-month probation, which Caldwell-Pope violated when he failed to submit a drug-and-alcohol screening over the summer.

His sentence has already forced him to miss two road games and he won’t be allowed to play at Houston on Dec. 31 or in Minnesota on New Year’s Day.

Caldwell-Pope signed a one-year, $18 million deal with the Lakers during the offseason. He’s averaging 14.2 points across 35 minutes per game.
