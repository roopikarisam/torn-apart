A former Elgin youth pastor will spend seven years in prison after pleading guilty Monday to sexually abusing a child in 2013 at a West Dundee Church.

The guilty plea came just before 36-year-old Chad A. Coe was set to go to trial on charges accusing him of having inappropriate contact with a minor, according to a news release from the Kane County State's Attorney's Office.

Kane County Judge James C. Hallock accepted the plea, which was met with the maximum seven-year penalty. Coe's attorney, Brittany Pedersen could not immediately be reached to comment Monday.

Assistant State’s Attorneys Debra Bree and Lori Schmidt stated in court that in June 2013 Coe had sexual contact with the victim at the church in the 900 block of South Eighth Street, West Dundee, according to the release.

Coe, of the 500 Block of Dundee Avenue, Elgin knew the victim and is required to register as a sex offender for life, the release stated.

“Not only was this victim abused by a person she thought she could trust, she persevered against him despite his attempts to minimize his criminal conduct by villainizing her and engaging in victim blaming," Kane County State’s Attorney Joe McMahon said in an official statement. "This case should be a reminder to the community that the vast majority of child sex crimes are committed by people who know their victims and seek to exploit those relationships.”

The Kane County Child Advocacy Center, West Dundee Police Department and Kane County Major Crimes Task Force investigated the case.

Coe previously was faced with a series of child pornography charges, which were dismissed in 2017, Kane County public records show.
