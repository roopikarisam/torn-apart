All actions and reactions have consequences, some more tragic than others.

That was the lesson in the courtroom Thursday as Rhonda Boisseau was sentenced for her involvement in a June crash that killed three people.

A large group of motorcyclists, including Andrew Torrice, was riding around on June 10. An altercation occurred between some of the motorcyclists and Boisseau, who was driving a Volkswagen. Boisseau got angry and followed the group.

Torrice, 24, sped away and ran a red light, striking a couple on a motorcycle, Adam Kammann, 34, and Christine Zadina, 37, in the intersection of 72nd and Cass Streets. The couple and Torrice died in the collision.

For her part in the chain of events, Boisseau, 58, was sentenced to one year of probation by Douglas County Judge Sheryl Lohaus.

“He did nothing to her that night,” Kristine Torrice told the judge while clutching a framed photo of her son.

Prosecutors had said they did not have enough evidence to charge Boisseau with motor vehicle homicide. They instead charged her with willful reckless driving. Prosecutor Tyler Hiipakka described Boisseau’s behavior that night as a “dangerous display of anger” because she followed the motorcyclists for blocks.

If Boisseau doesn’t successfully complete her probation, she could serve 90 days in jail. Lohaus also revoked Boisseau’s driver’s license for 30 days and ordered her to pay a $500 fine and take anger management and victim empathy classes.

Torrice’s sister, Emily Shoe, stormed out of the courtroom as the judge delivered her sentence.

“She killed my brother!” Shoe yelled. “She’s not going to jail.”

Relatives of Kammann and Zadina issued a statement that said, in part, “The reckless decisions by multiple people that night led to the senseless deaths of Adam and Christine. They were both wonderful people who cared deeply for their family and cherished their friends.”

They asked that people think of the couple the next time they drive or ride.

Kristine Torrice sobbed after the sentence.

“What she did cost the lives of three people,” Torrice said of Boisseau. “Three people that did nothing to her.”

Boisseau’s lawyer, Mike Wilson, said Boisseau expresses sympathy for the families of the three people who died. He said Boisseau has received threats, had to change her phone number and hears people yell at her while she is inside her home.

“The justice system has spoken at this point,” Wilson said. “We hope the community, while they don’t have to embrace (the sentence), we hope they will respect it.”

Michaela Zellers, Zadina’s sister, said drivers of all vehicles should respect traffic laws and be respectful of each other.

“She played a part in this,” Zellers said. “I hope (Boisseau) looks at my sister’s face every day and it haunts her.”

About 75 people gathered on the southeast corner of 72nd and Cass Streets on Wednesday evening to remember three motorcyclists killed at the intersection last June.

When is the good Judge up for a vote to keep or dismiss. Remember people.

Guess the judge was willing to overlook the fact that she lied to the police initially, telling them she wasn’t even in the area. Thought you couldn’t do that? 

It's not so much the Judge's fault as it is the Prosecutor that allowed her to plea down to a misdemeanor.  You'd think he had a stronger case than that!  


What a shame.

We have a completely broken judicial system. . . ..this woman is dangerous and this judge failed us all. . .

Why is 

I am so sorry for your loss and truly sympathize with your families. Without living in the area and having more details of the accident, it would appear that this article was written in error. The article made it sound as if the the biker ran the stop sign and ran into the other bike carrying two people. From the sound of the comments, it makes it sound like the woman driving the Volkswagon was the one responsible for the death of your loved ones. I am really confused. Maybe someone can clear up the details for all of us unfamiliar with the situation. Thank you.

What do you expect from the World Herald?  I'm surprised they didn't mention whether the parties involved were loyal Husker fans...and what they thought about Scott Frost. 

There were two completely innocent people involved.   One was not Andrew Torrice.
