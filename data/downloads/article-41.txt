A young woman from Watertown, Minn., died last week of a fentanyl overdose and a 29-year-old man who allegedly supplied her with the drug has been arrested.

The victim was identified as Olivia Rose Zorbas, 19. She was found dead shortly before 6 p.m. Friday when deputies responded to a medical emergency in Watertown.

Deputies found drug paraphernalia and a white powder that tested positive for fentanyl in the home.

Deon Lee Hillard of Minneapolis was identified as the alleged drug dealer and was arrested Monday. He has been charged with third-degree murder and is being held in the Carver County jail.
