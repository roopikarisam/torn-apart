David Anthony Kirk, 20, and Jack Ryan Smith, 26, were arrested and have been charged with sexual battery, according to Orange County Sheriff’s Office arrest reports.

The attorney for a University of Central Florida student accused of gang-raping a woman Friday night during an off-campus party says “no less than five” people witnessed the incident.


His client, David Anthony Kirk, was booked into Orange County jail late Tuesday on sexual battery charges, after a woman said he and another man forced her to have sex with them while she was too drunk to consent. Kirk, 20, is being held in jail on $5,000 bond.


A second UCF student was also charged. Jack Ryan Smith, 26, was arrested Saturday. He paid his $10,000 bond and was released.


The woman told deputies she was stumbling and slurring her words and blacked out at the party at a home near UCF, only remembering “snapshots” of the night, according to an arrest affadavit. She said she woke up in a bedroom, on her stomach in a bed and naked. Smith, she told deputies, was raping her, according to the report. At the same time, Kirk was forcing her to perform oral sex on him, the report said.


The woman said she was in shock and numb, the report said, adding that she heard one of the men saying “my turn, my turn,” and the pair switched positions as she cried.


Ken Lewis, who is representing Kirk, took issue with the charge against his client, sexual battery on an incapacitated person, saying the allegation didn’t meet that standard, which means a person is bodily impaired or handicapped and substantially impaired or limited in the ability to resist or flee. He said his client was “100 percent innocent.”


“The girl basically gives numerous accounts of what went on and then says she was passed out,” Lewis said during his client’s first appearance. “And there’s not a single piece of physical evidence and there’s not a single supporting witness.”


He said the woman started texting others “after somebody walked in and she was embarrassed because she was caught in the act.”


Lewis said he called the detective who investigated the incident and urged her not to arrest Kirk.


“What do you have to support that this isn’t remorse of a girl that engaged in sexual activity of which we have numerous witnesses?” he asked the detective. “I have no less than five witnesses.”


The detective didn’t want to hear any of it, he said.
