Anthony Galea, the Toronto physician whose U.S. clients included former Yankee Alex Rodriguez, golfer Tiger Woods, Jose Reyes, Carlos Beltran and others, had his medical license suspended in Canada for nine months and was fined $21,500 by a Canadian medical regulatory body Wednesday.

The discipline committee for the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario (CPSO) made the announcement just over a year after it had found Galea "committed an act of professional misconduct." The committee's 2016 decision on Galea was based upon evidence and information from his U.S. federal case, in which Galea ultimately pleaded guilty in 2011 to bringing misbranded and unapproved drugs across the border to treat professional athletes.

Galea has never had a license to practice medicine in the U.S.

Galea told the Daily News earlier this year that he was "at the mercy of the committee," and that he was prepared to lose his medical license if the CPSO discipline committee came to that conclusion. Instead, Galea had his medical license suspended for nine months in Canada, "effective immediately," and has to pay the college $21,500 within 60 days. Galea must also appear before the committee "to be reprimanded within 60 days of the date of this order," a CPSO spokeswoman said.

Galea could not be reached. His lawyer, Brian Greenspan, did not return calls and an email for comment.

At the height of the doping scandal involving Galea in 2010, the Toronto physician denied ever treating A-Rod with anything other than anti-inflammatory medication following Rodriguez's first hip surgery in 2009.

"There were no performance enhancers with anything I was doing," Galea told The News earlier this year, when asked about his past. "But when I was indicted, that was it. It changed the course of history."

Galea, 58, was sentenced to one year of supervised release in Buffalo federal court in 2011. He can appeal the CPSO's discipline, but there is no indication yet that Galea will take that step.
