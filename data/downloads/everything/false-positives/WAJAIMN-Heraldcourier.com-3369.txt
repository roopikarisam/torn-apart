ABINGDON, Va. -- An Abingdon Virginia attorney has been charged with distributing drugs inside the Washington County Virginia court house, according to a statement from the Washington County Sheriff's Office. 


On Thursday, Feb. 8, 2018, Deputy Jon Cumbw, while working court security, observed a folded paper being passed from an attorney to his client in the court room. This occurred while circuit court was in session and the attorney and client were at counsel table. Deputy Cumbow later took the folded paper from the client, who was an inmate, after the court hearing was over to inspect it. The deputy found a suboxone strip. 


George "Chip" Ed Barker Jr., 57, of Meadowview, Va., was arrested and charged with felony sell, give or distribute Suboxone. He was transported to the Abingdon facility of the Southwest Virginia Regional Jail where he was released on an unsecure bond.
