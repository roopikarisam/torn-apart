'Peeping Tom': Georgia high school student Steven Bahner, 17, has been charged with a felony after being accused of secretly recording a sex act between two teenagers 

An Atlanta-area high school student is facing a felony charge after being accused of secretly recording a sex act between two teenagers inside a school bathroom.


An arrest warrant says 17-year-old Steven Bahner reached over a closed bathroom stall at Harrison High School in Kennesaw and recorded a 15-year-old girl with a 16-year-old boy. 


That video spread via social media, air drop and group chats. An assistant principal notified police after discovering the video last Wednesday. 


According to the warrant cited by WSB-TV, Bahner told school administrators he took the video because he didn't understand how the school could let the sex act happen, but also because he wanted to show it to his friends.


Cobb County police say the sex act was consensual and the students were recorded inside a locked bathroom stall without their knowledge.

Bahner is charged with eavesdropping-surveillance, a felony. He was released from the county jail on Thursday morning after posting bond. 


In addition to the criminal charges, the 17-year-old is expected to face disciplinary actions at school.
