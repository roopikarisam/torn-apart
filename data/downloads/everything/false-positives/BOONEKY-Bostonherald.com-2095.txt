INDIANAPOLIS â€” Several dozen police officers saluted the flag-draped body of a slain central Indiana sheriff's deputy as it was taken from a hospital Monday three days after he was shot during a chase.


Scores of police vehicles and motorcycles escorted the hearse carrying Boone County Deputy Jacob Pickett's body for several miles from St. Vincent Hospital on the north side of Indianapolis to the Marion County coroner's office in the downtown area.
