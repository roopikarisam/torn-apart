Grammy Award-winning record producer and rapper Timbaland just bought a waterfront condo under construction in Miami’s Arts &amp; Entertainment District.

Timbaland, whose real name is Timothy Zachery “Tim” Mosley, closed on two units at Aria on the Bay, Cervera Real Estate’s John Parsiani said. Parsiani, a senior sales executive for the project, declined to provide a price. Sources said the units were listed for about $4 million.

His combined condo spans more than 4,700 square feet with an additional 1,300 square feet of terrace space. Tim Elmes of Coldwell Banker and Marc Hameroff of Engel &amp; Völkers Miami represented the record producer. Elmes could not immediately be reached for comment.

Timbaland, who has worked with artists like Ginuwine, Aaliyah, Justin Timberlake, Jay-Z and Ludacris, will be able to move in soon. The Melo Group plans to get its certificate of occupancy for Aria on the Bay by March, Parsiani said. The 53-story, 648-unit building at 1770 North Bayshore Drive is nearly 90 percent sold.

Last year, former Miami Marlins outfielder Giancarlo Stanton also bought a unit at the luxury condo tower.

Aria’s amenities will include two swimming pools, a spa, gym, yoga room, a bar and entertainment lounge, a screening room and a game room. The building was designed by Arquitectonica and will also have about 20,000 square feet of commercial space, including office, retail and restaurant space at the ground level.

Prices for remaining units range from the $400,000s to about $1.8 million.
