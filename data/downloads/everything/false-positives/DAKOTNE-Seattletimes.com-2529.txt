VERMILLION, S.D. (AP) — Two University of South Dakota football players accused in a sexual assault have been released from jail on bond.

The Clay County Jail says 20-year-old Danny Rambo and 21-year-old Dale Williamson were released Tuesday. Bond had been set at $25,000 for Rambo and $20,000 for Williamson.

Rambo is charged with felony rape and Williamson with felony attempted rape. They haven’t yet entered pleas. They’re due back in court next Tuesday.

According to police, a woman says Rambo and Williamson entered a bedroom where she was having consensual sex with another player and assaulted her Oct. 22 at the off-campus residence the three players shared.

All three players have been suspended indefinitely from the team. Rambo is a junior defensive back from Texarkana, Texas. Williamson is a sophomore reserve defensive back from Donalsonville, Georgia.
