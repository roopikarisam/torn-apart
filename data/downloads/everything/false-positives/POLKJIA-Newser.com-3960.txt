                                        A 53-year-old woman riding a horse down a busy Florida highway has been arrested and charged with driving drunk, the AP reports. Polk County Sheriff's officials said someone called 911 about a woman who appeared confused and possibly in danger. When deputies arrived they found Donna Byrne riding her horse in the road.
                                    


                                        


 Officers did a sobriety test and said Byrne gave breath samples that registered a blood-alcohol level of .161—twice Florida's legal limit of .08. Byrne is charged with DUI and animal neglect for endangering and failing to provide proper protection for the horse. Deputies took the horse to the Polk County Sheriff's Animal Control livestock facility. Byrne was booked into the Polk County Jail.
