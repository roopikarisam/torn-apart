Gobi Oasis, Dalandzadag, Mongolia. While the distance was ‘just’
    234km for today’s stage of the 2018 BMW Motorrad GS Trophy in
    Mongolia, the fact 190 of those kilometres were off-road meant the
    intensity for the riders was high.

That said, the day started gently with a scenic ride over rocky
    outcrops as the course weaved its way out from Camp Tsagaan Survaga
    toward a huge sand and grass plain, 30km across – an experience that
    was akin to surfing as the GSs floated over the terrain.

Typically, the semi-desert then changed in nature at the 100km
      mark, becoming a gravel plain that led to a rock formation in the
      shape of a camel head, where a special test called “Camel Head”
      required the teams to ride a sand and rock trials course, this
      time simultaneously as a team.

Immediately after the test the terrain changed in nature again,
      this time to deep sand, which required fine balance and throttle
      control at slow speeds. By now noon had come and gone, and the air
      temperature was 32o – with no cooling breeze. As the course wound
      its way up a narrow valley the sand remained deep, deeper still in
      the dried up river beds, and many a GS rider came to a halt.
      Teamwork comes to the fore at times like this, as the team members
      pushed, pulled and helped guide each other through the sand-maze.

The valley led to a high plateau with several rocky outcrops to
      navigate around before reaching a dry lake (a clay pan) where the
      riders found special test 5 that required them to ride a tight
      snaking course against the clock, with a defined stop box at the
      finish. While again slow speed, this test required fine balance
      and throttle and clutch control as the fastest riders drifted in
      and out of the tight turns.

With the afternoon heat staying at the 32o mark the teams were
      thankful to find a shortish final 50km section along gravel tracks
      to the finish.

Unfortunately a few riders have fallen today. Each received
      immediate attention from the professional medical team at the
      event. They have been transferred to hospital. 

The voting on the photo contest has been postponed by 24
            hours and voting for the first photo competition will now
            open at 23:59 Mongolian time on June 5.
