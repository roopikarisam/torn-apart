SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. (AP) â€” A former Salt River Police Department officer has been sentenced to six months in jail for unlawful sexual conduct involving a woman in his custody.

Maricopa County Superior Court Judge Michael Kemp on Friday also placed 46-year-old Jay Hun Wu on lifetime probation and ordered him to register as a sex offender.

Wu pleaded guilty to violating a law prohibiting a police officer from knowingly engaging in sexual contact with a person in the officer's custody.

He pleaded guilty under an agreement with prosecutors. He originally was also charged with kidnapping and assault.

A woman reported that Wu sexually abused her after Wu gave her a courtesy ride home when she was the subject of an investigation.

The Salt River Police Department serves the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community.
