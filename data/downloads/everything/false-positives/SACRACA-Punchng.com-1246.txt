Former NBA player J.J. Hickson is being held without bail in the Coweta County (Georgia) Jail on a charge of armed robbery with a knife, according to online records.

He was arrested Friday and currently is awaiting trial.

Coweta County Sheriff’s Department spokesman Jimmy Yarbrough told multiple media outlets that the arrest took place in connection with a home invasion in Senoia, Georgia. Yarbrough said that several items were allegedly taken and a person was attacked. Although at least two people were involved with the alleged home invasion, only Hickson was charged, Yarbrough said.


Hickson, who played in high school in Marietta, Georgia, and collegiately at NC State and was drafted by the Cleveland Cavaliers with the 19th overall pick in the 2008 NBA draft.

Hickson, 29, made at least $27 million in his eight-season NBA career, playing for Cleveland, the Sacramento Kings, Portland Trail Blazers, Denver Nuggets and Washington Wizards. He averaged 9.5 points and 6.8 rebounds, last appearing in a game in 2015-16 season.

He has played overseas since and most recently was with the Champville team in the Lebanese Basketball League in 2018.
