A man who forced his way into a Pennsville home and fired a weapon was arrested Monday, police said.

Raymond C. Keller, 30, of Carneys Point, faces aggravated burglary, terroristic threats and weapons charges, according to the Pennsville Police Department.

The burglary took place Sunday morning just before 10:30 a.m., police said. Officers responded to a call to a Williams Drive home and spoke to a woman who said a man, later identified as Keller, had broken into the house looking for someone named Chris who was staying at the home, according to police. 

Before finding Chris, Keller allegedly fired a gun in the home and fled in a small, red vehicle. 

No one was injured during the break-in, police said. 

Officers later found the vehicle in Carneys Point, but could not locate Keller. Police put out a warrant charging, and said he appeared at police headquarters Monday, where he was taken into custody. 

Keller is being held in the Salem County Correctional Facility.
