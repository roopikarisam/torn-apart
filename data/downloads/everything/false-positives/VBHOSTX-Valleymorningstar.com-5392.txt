This undated Nevada Department of Corrections photo shows death row inmate Scott Raymond Dozier, who was convicted in 2007 of robbing, killing and dismembering a 22-year-old man in Las Vegas, and was convicted in Arizona in 2005 of another murder and dismemberment near Phoenix. Dozier is slated to die Wednesday, July 11, 2018, by a three-drug lethal injection combination never before tried in any state and has said repeatedly he wants his sentence carried out and he doesn't care if it's painful.

OLMITO — Apparently it doesn’t matter that Jaciel Cantu left the man he allegedly shot at a hospital on Monday.

According to Sheriff Omar Lucio, Cantu is a person of interest and wanted for shooting Alejandro Dominguez, 17, in the stomach at his home some time after 4 p.m. on Monday outside of San Benito.

Cantu is considered dangerous.

“He is capable of doing anything,” Lucio said about Cantu.

Police received a call at 4:27 p.m. that someone had been shot on Relin Circle in the Arroyo Estates neighborhood outside of San Benito.

As of yesterday afternoon, nearly 48 hours after the shooting, Cantu was still not in police custody.

Authorities found the black Ford Fusion Cantu was driving crashed in a ditch near FM 1846 (commonly known as Williams Road) and Castillo Road about 5 p.m. on Monday.

Dominguez had been dropped off at Valley Baptist Medical Center after 4:30 p.m.

Lucio said Dominguez was treated and was in stable condition after surgery to remove the bullet from his stomach.

Police are seeking information from anyone to help locate Cantu.

Anyone with a tip should call the Sheriff’s Office, local police or Harlingen Area Crime Stoppers hotline.

According to Lucio, Cantu is about 18 years old and faces a second-degree felony for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.

If convicted he could go to prison for five to 20 years and be handed a fine up to $10,000.

Investigators were still looking into the case and had not been able to speak to Dominguez on Monday after his surgery.

Police stated they did not know how the two men knew each other or a motive for the shooting.

The shooting happened at the Arroyo Colorado Estates subdivision off Williams Road at 25786 Reline Circle.

“He rendered aid, but that does not mean anything,” Lucio said at yesterday’s press conference. “But I am glad he did.”
