Beaver, W.Va. (WVNS) - Robert Sluss was found guilty after deputies said he is responsible for an accident that happened on August 8, 2015 on Route 19 where Sluss injured several people. One of the victims was paralyzed as a result of the crash.


On Friday, January 5, 2018 Judge Burnside in Raleigh County found Sluss guilty on one felony count of DUI causing serious bodily injury and two misdemeanor counts of DUI causing bodily injury.


Sluss now faces four to 12 years behind bars.


Those in the judicial system hope this serves as a lesson for all drivers. "I just hope it sends a message that if you're consuming alcohol that you don't drive or arrange for a designated driver. You call for a taxi or an Uber," an Assistant Prosecuting Attorney in Raleigh County, Thomas MacAulay said.


Sluss is currently being held in the Southern Regional Jail as he awaits sentencing in early March.

Robert Sluss faces up to 13 years behind bars after driving drunk and seriously injuring innocent drivers.


"He said help me, help me, I'm dying," a victim of the crash, Jane Chipps said. "I'm going to bleed to death here," another victim, Thomas Chipps added.


It was August 8, 2015 when Thomas Chipps and his wife saw their lives flash before their eyes. "I thought oh my God, I'm paralyzed, I tried to lift my arms and I couldn't move, I was totally 100 percent paralyzed," Thomas Chipps said.


A man who was once in excellent shape, now struggles to get around and authorities explained Robert Sluss is to blame. "I asked him if he had anything to drink and he told me he had some vodka with his coffee that morning," a Deputy with the Raleigh County Sheriff's Office, Jason Redden said.


It was Aug. 8, 2015 along Route 19 where the accident happened. Witnesses said two cars were stopped near Grandview Road and it appeared they were waiting for a car to turn. That's when witnesses explained they saw a car coming down the northbound lane speeding. From there Chipps said his car was in the side of the southbound lane hoping to escape the hit, but that's when the fear became reality.


"I remember tumbling with the truck," Jane Chipps said.


Sluss's car rear ended the two cars in the North bound lane then skidded over and hit Chipps truck. "I just could not believe it happened because I was so far from the truck," Thomas Chipps said.


After failing field sobriety tests, Sluss was put under arrest, but it's those sobriety tests that Sluss' defense said could be inaccurate.  


Now Sluss will return to court Jan, 4, 2018 awaiting his fate as he faces over a decade behind bars.
