How much does one conference road loss cost a team in the Associated Press Top 25? Apparently, six spots. 


After getting romped at Marquette, Seton Hall basketball fell from No. 13 last week to No. 19 in this week's poll, which came out Monday afternoon. The Pirates (15-3 overall, 4-1 Big East) travel to Creighton Wednesday and play host to No. 11 Xavier Saturday. 


Here is my ballot, followed by a brief explanation. 


1. Villanova (16-1)


2. Virginia (16-1)


3. Purdue (17-2)


4. Oklahoma (14-2)


5. Texas Tech (15-2)


6. West Virginia (15-2)


7. Wichita State (15-2)


8. Duke (15-2)


9. Michigan State (16-3)


10. Xavier (16-3)


11. Kansas (14-3)


12. Cincinnati (15-2)


13. Gonzaga (16-3)


14. Arizona (14-4)


15. North Carolina (14-4)


16. Arizona State (14-3)


17. Clemson (15-2)


18. Seton Hall (15-3)


19. Ohio State (15-4)


20. Kentucky (14-3)


21. Auburn (16-1)


22. Michigan (15-4)


23. Tennessee (12-4)


24. Rhode Island (13-3)


25. Creighton (14-4)


Seton Hall basketball: Nostalgic homecoming for P.J. Carlesimo, 1992-93 Pirates


Also considered: Nevada (16-3) and Saint Mary’s (17-2).


Entered: Ohio State at No. 19 after opening 6-0 in Big Ten play; Michigan at No. 22 after winning at Michigan State; Rhode Island at No. 24 after winning eight straight.


Dropped out: No. 16 TCU (13-4) after losses to Texas and No. 9 Oklahoma; No. 18 Miami (13-3) after a loss to No. 19 Clemson; No. 23 Florida State (13-4) after a loss to Louisville.


Analysis: The big winner is Oklahoma, which rises five spots after beating Texas Tech and TCU . . . Three squads fell five spots after losses: Michigan State (to Michigan), Arizona State (to Oregon) and Seton Hall (to Marquette) . . . I punished Miami more than those three because their resume continues to weaken as signature win Minnesota nosedives . . . Good week for the Big Ten, which has four ranked teams for the first time . . . My ballot by conference: ACC (4), Big 12 (4), Big East (4), Big Ten (4), SEC (3), Pac-12 (2), American (2), Atlantic 10 (1), WCC (1).
