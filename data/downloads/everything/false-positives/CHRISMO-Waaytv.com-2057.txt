Both men are being held without bond in the Madison County Jail.

 Two men are in jail facing murder charges for the killing of a man at an abandoned Huntsville apartment building. 

 James Michael Romans, 24, and Michael Christian Stoltzfus, 30, were arrested Wednesday night and charged with murder. 

 Huntsville police said the victim was found in an empty apartment building on Boxwood Court Wednesday morning. 

 According to Lt. Michael Johnson, preliminary evidence shows that the victim was attacked by two people. Johnson added in a statement "that the altercation is over a domestic situation between one of the offenders and the victim." 

 Court records show that both men were out on probation when they were arrested.  

 Stoltsfus was placed on a two-year probation after he pleaded guilty to a first degree theft by deception charge. He was granted probation in March 2017.  

 Similarly, Romans pleaded guilty in 2016 to a charge of second degree theft by deception.  

 But while court documents show Romans violated the terms of his probation in January 2018, a Madison County judge reinstated the terms of his probation.  

 Also last month, Romans pleaded guilty to a possession of a forged instrument charge in Limestone County and was put on a three-year probation for that. 

 The victim's name has not been released. Police have not given a possible reason for the murder. 

 Both Romans and Stoltzfus are being held in the Madison County Jail. Bond has not been set for either man, according to jail records.
