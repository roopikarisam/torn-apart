ROCKVILLE, Md., Nov. 17, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Travelers voted to select Cambria Hotels the "Best New Emerging Brand" at the 4th Annual American Group Travel Awards (AGTA) by HotelPlanner.com. The AGTA showcases organizations offering the highest quality of group travel experiences and outstanding service across the hospitality industry.


Cambria Hotels offer guests a distinct experience with simple, guilt-free indulgences, allowing them to treat themselves while on the road. The brand is continuing to grow into major urban markets with recent hotel openings in Chicago, New York City, New Orleans, Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles. 

"It has been an exciting year of milestones for the Cambria brand as it expands from coast to coast. We hold this recognition in high regard because the endorsement comes from Cambria guests," said Janis Cannon, senior vice president, upscale brands at Choice Hotels. "With each Cambria hotel that opens its doors, we strive to offer a truly special experience designed for the needs of the modern traveler and that captures the character of the local destination." 


Nominees for each category were selected by a panel of travel and hospitality industry experts based on quality of services, experiences, and customer satisfaction for group travelers. Voting was then open to the public. 


Cambria Hotels is one of 11 global brands that make up Choice Hotels International, including the Ascend Hotel Collection, Comfort Inn, Comfort Suites, Sleep Inn, Quality Inn, Clarion, MainStay Suites, Suburban Extended Stay Hotel, Econo Lodge and Rodeway Inn.
