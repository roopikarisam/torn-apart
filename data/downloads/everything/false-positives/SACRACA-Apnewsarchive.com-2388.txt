SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) â€” Two former California state employees are going to jail for using state computers to mine digital currency.

The Sacramento County District Attorney's Office said that a judge sentenced Jeffrey Rikala and Jonathan Turrentine to 30 days in jail Monday.

They pleaded no contest to illegally accessing a computer network to wrongfully obtain money.

They were employed by the California Department of Technology in 2016 when they used state computer servers to mine Monero, a form of cryptocurrency.


The Sacramento Bee reports that the men were software systems specialists.

Department spokesman Bryce Brown tells the newspaper that neither works for the department today. Rikala's last day was in May 2017 and Turrentine's was in November 2016.
