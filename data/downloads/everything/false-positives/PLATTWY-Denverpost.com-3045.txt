Denver Public Works closed down the eastbound lane of East Yale Avenue between South Dahlia Street and Interstate 25 Thursday after workers noticed signs that the street had become destabilized.

Denver Public Works spokeswoman Nancy Kuhn said workers arenâ€™t sure exactly what happened but suspected dirt under the road had shifted, making it unstable for cars to be driving on, as workers put in a stormwater project.

Eastbound traffic is being diverted to East Hampden Avenue, she said. She did not know when the roadway would re-opened.

Traffic on the street has already been down to one lane in each direction. Workers began putting in the stormwater project in January in an attempt to address major flooding issues that have been occurring for decades. The project was expected to take between four and six months.
