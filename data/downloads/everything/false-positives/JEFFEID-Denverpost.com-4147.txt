Jefferson County Sheriffâ€™s deputies responding to reports of a man breaking into a car early Tuesday morning found the suspect because he tried to flee the scene in a Lyft.

Just after 1:30 a.m. Tuesday, deputies were called to West Rice Avenue by a resident who confronted a man who was breaking into a car. The man, who was carrying a backpack and wearing a yellow hoodie, ran away from the resident.

Deputies searched for him with no luck.

About 30 minutes later, Deputy J. Allen saw a Lyft driver come into the neighborhood and drop off a female passenger, who went into her home. A minute later, a second Lyft driver entered the neighborhood, pulled up to the intersection and stopped.

Allen spoke to the driver, who told him that he was supposed to pick up a man named Adam at that intersection, but no one was there. Allen drove a short distance away, turned off his lights and waited, the post says.

A moment later, a man emerged from emerged from overgrown bushes nearby and got into the Lyft.

Deputy Allen then drove up and spoke to the passenger. The man was sweaty, carrying a backpack and had a yellow hoodie.

Although the suspect, Adam J. Vultaggio, 27, told Allen that he had not broken into any cars, investigators found items that had been stolen from vehicles in his possession, as well as a knife and drug paraphernalia.

He was arrested and booked into the Jefferson County jail.
