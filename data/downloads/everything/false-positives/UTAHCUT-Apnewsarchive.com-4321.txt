LOGAN, Utah (AP) â€” A woman was sentenced to a year in jail for causing a crash that involved multiple vehicles in a northern Utah city and led to her husband's death last year.

The sentence was handed down in a Logan courtroom on Tuesday after 43-year-old Eska Miller Bird pleaded guilty in October to a felony charge of attempted manslaughter and misdemeanor charges of reckless endangerment.

Authorities say Bird was speeding through Smithfield in October 2016 when she turned into oncoming traffic. The collision caused a chain of wrecks and fatally injured 52-year-old William Bird who died the next month. Authorities say nine people were injured from the wrecks.

Bird was also sentenced to three years of probation and 300 hours of community service on top of the Cache County jail sentence.
