An Antioch couple were being held in lieu of $350,000 bail after the pair allegedly used a baseball bat and gun to rob a service station Sunday in Antioch Township.


Jason R. Haines, 31, and Holly C. Van Crey, 26, of the 1200 block of Main Street, Antioch, each was charged with armed robbery, aggravated armed robbery, burglary and unlawful possession of marijuana with intent to deliver, according to Sgt. Christopher Covelli of the Lake County Sheriff's office.


When the two victims described the offenders to deputies who responded to the scene of the crime at the Citgo service station at 41082 N. Route 83, one of the deputies who regularly patrols the area recognized the suspects from the description given and knew where they lived.


According to Covelli, a store employee and a business patron were locking up shortly after 10 p.m. when a man with a baseball bat and a woman with a pistol forced the two back inside the station where they took products and cash.


Deputies went to the couple's apartment and inside found proceeds from the robbery, according to reports. More proceeds were discovered when the sheriff's police dog Diesel tracked their scent to a cache in a field near their apartment.


Both were in Lake County Jail Monday and are scheduled to appear in court Jan. 2.
