Shane Anthony Vernon, 27, broke free from Coosa County Prison in Rockford, south-east of Birmingham, on Sunday at about 2.30pm

An Alabama inmate has managed to escape prison for the second time in less than one month. 


Shane Anthony Vernon, 27, broke free from Coosa County Prison in Rockford, south-east of Birmingham, on Sunday at about 2.30pm.


Sheriff Terry Wilson said Vernon had 'physically circumvented the security of the jail' when he made his latest prison escape.


Vernon, who authorities warn is armed and dangerous, was last seen in a wooded area of Elmore County, close to the Coosa County line.  


Authorities believe Vernon stole an electric dirt bike in Elmore County to make his escape.


Vernon had previously escaped the prison back on October 29 when he was being booked into the county jail. 


He forcibly removed his restraints and ran away from the prison.


Authorities say he was recaptured nearby the following day.





Vernon was being held on multiple felony charges, which according to online jail records, include burglary and auto theft. 


He is described as a white male, 5-feet, 7-inches tall and weighing 130 pounds.


He also has several identifying tattoos on his body, including 'ride or die' on his right fist, a Chinese symbol on his neck and the word 'county' on his left shoulder blade.
