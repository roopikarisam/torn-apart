A Florida woman accused of stealing at least $25,000 from an elderly Boulder County woman diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease was booked into the Boulder County Jail on Sunday.

In an arrest warrant affidavit signed by a Boulder County judge in July, Marina Thelma Scotti, 48, is charged with a single count of felony theft from an at-risk adult. The theft is alleged to have happened between December and January.

The alleged victim in the case is an 89-year-old Boulder County woman who was recently diagnosed with Alzheimer’s and suffers from diminished mental capacity. A friend was helping manage her finances and came across numerous suspicious checks that had been written to a Florida-based company called “Publications Marketing.”
