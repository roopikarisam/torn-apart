As Irma's misery grows in scope and scale, so does its death toll. The most powerful hurricane ever recorded in the open Atlantic eventually claimed dozens of lives as it tore up the Caribbean and the southeastern United States. Still more are dying in its aftermath.

The victims include eight residents of a sweltering Florida nursing home. Others have died in storm-related traffic accidents, fallen from ladders or been poisoned by generators running inside homes. Still others have drowned, been electrocuted, crushed by tree limbs and crumbling buildings or suffered fatal injuries while cleaning up debris.


Here are brief portraits of some of Irma's victims:

Gail Nova, 71, Hollywood

She was one of eight people who died Wednesday after the Rehabilitation Center at Hollywood Hills, lost air conditioning due to the storm. Her ex-husband Kenneth Nova, 73, said the family is devastated.

"Gail was a real spirit. She's a good lady," Nova said from his home in Winter Haven, Florida.

She had only one child, the couple's son Jeffrey, and a 17-year-old granddaughter.

A former certified nursing assistant at the home, Natasha Johnson, said Nova "was always sweet ... I'm from the islands and she used to love listening to island music. She had great energy."

___

Bobby Owens, 84, Hollywood

He was another of the eight residents of the Rehabilitation Center who died Wednesday after conditions became dangerously hot.

His daughter, Glendale, said she last visited her father Monday, "and he was fine."

She said he'd lived there for more than 10 years.

Elvin Milian, 26, Hialeah

Emergency responders from Miami-Dade County found the man ill Wednesday at his home, where a generator was running.

The county medical examiner is awaiting toxicology results before ruling on the cause of death, but authorities say carbon monoxide poisoning likely killed him.

Jan Lebron Diaz, 13

Kiara Lebron Diaz, 16

Desiree Diaz Molina, 34, Orlando

Orange County sheriff's deputies on Tuesday afternoon found the teens and woman dead, and four others were taken to a hospital for treatment of carbon monoxide poisoning.

A portable generator had been running inside the home.

Deputies said in a news release that those who died and were sickened appear to belong to the same family.

Terryn Wilson, 7, Lakeland


Terryn died Wednesday from carbon-monoxide intoxication at her home, where a generator was running inside after Hurricane Irma, a medical examiner said.

Polk County sheriff's officials said her mother, Shashunda Wilson, called 911, saying she woke up feeling dizzy and her daughter appeared to be dead. They had been sleeping in the bedroom with a fan blowing.

Rescue workers found the mother sitting outside. She was taken to a Miami hospital after telling rescuers the generator was still running in the living room. They had to open windows to let the deadly gas out before retrieving the girl's body.

The mother "told detectives that she recently obtained a generator due to having lost power during Hurricane Irma, and that this was the first time she had used one, and she was not aware that it could not be in the home," the sheriff's statement said.

Freddie Bryant, 68, Largo

Bryant, preparing to evacuate his mobile home because of the approaching hurricane, died after falling and striking his head, according to the medical examiner's office.

Bill Pellan, director of investigations for the office that serves Pinellas and Pasco counties, said Bryant died Friday at a St. Petersburg hospital, a day after the accident outside his home.

Pellan said Bryant fell as he and his wife packed their car. He died as a result of complications from blunt head trauma.

The death preceded the storm but came after Gov. Rick Scott declared a state of emergency Sept. 4.

Daniels, who feared storm-related flooding and fled his home, died Sunday night after crashing his vehicle into a tree, according to the medical examiner's office.

David Boatswain, 65, Miami

Boatswain died of carbon monoxide poisoning from a generator running inside his home.

A neighbor discovered Boatswain in his home Monday morning after he didn't answer his phone, Miami-Dade Police Officer Robin Pinkard said Tuesday. Emergency responders said the home tested positive for carbon monoxide, and the medical examiner confirmed Thursday he had died from "carbon monoxide toxicity.'

"Remember, we've always been saying, when you're operating a generator, make sure you run it in an open space, not an enclosed space," Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez said in announcing Boatswain's death. "Unfortunately, in this case, the generator was run inside."

Ossman's car ended up on a grass shoulder, while Bridges' patrol car came to a rest in a nearby intersection. It wasn't immediately clear which vehicle crossed into the oncoming lane.

Buwalda died Monday after apparently being electrocuted by a downed power line, police said.

Wilfredo Hernandez, 55, Tampa

Hernandez died when the chain saw he was using to clear trees in the aftermath of Hurricane Irma became entangled in a branch, causing it to kick up and cut his carotid artery.

Nunez said deputies used a harness to lower the man from the tree, but he died at the scene.

Franco died at the Rehabilitation Center where he was a resident along with his wife.

His wife, who suffers from Alzheimer's disease, was hospitalized and unable to understand what occurred on the day that eight patients died, their son Pedro Franco told WSVN-TV. Pedro Franco said he visited his parents at the nursing last week and both seemed fine.

"This is something that could've been prevented," he said.

___

Albertina Vega, 99, Hollywood

A celebration for Vega's 100th birthday next month was planned at the nursing home where she was among the eight who died Wednesday.

She loved pink lipstick and vacations at Fort Meyers, the Sun Sentinel reported.
