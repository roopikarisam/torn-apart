ALBANY, Ga. (AP) â€” Authorities say a man who fled overseas a decade ago to avoid charges in a Georgia slaying is now jailed in the state.

WALB-TV reports federal marshals delivered 41-year-old Neil Adam Smith to the Dougherty County jail after escorting him on a plane Thursday from London.

Smith is charged with murder in the 2008 drive-by shooting of Cleveland Carter in Albany. Smith is an English citizen, and District Attorney Greg Edwards said it took a long time to extradite the suspect. It was not immediately known if Smith had an attorney.

Authorities say Smith and a woman also charged in the case, Yolanda Cleveland, fled to California and then flew overseas following the killing 10 years ago. Cleveland is jailed in London and fighting extradition to Georgia.
