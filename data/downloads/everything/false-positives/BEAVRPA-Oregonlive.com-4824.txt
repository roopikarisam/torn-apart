BANDON — Authorities say a man has been arrested after a dog was caught and killed last week in an illegal trap south of Coos Bay.

The World reports 57-year-old Monte Callaway of Bandon has been arrested by Oregon State Police Fish and Wildlife Division.

Oregon State Police Trooper Brian Koell says authorities responded to a call on June 11 reporting that the family dog was found dead in a trap on the neighbor's property.

When police contacted Callaway, troopers say they found that a trap had been used illegally.

Callaway remains in Coos County Jail on an animal abuse charge and other charges related to illegal trapping.

Koell says the type of trap Callaway allegedly set is usually used to trap beaver.

It wasn't immediately known if Callaway has a lawyer.
