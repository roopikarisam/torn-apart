ANGOLA, Ind. (AP) — A northeastern Indiana man faces intimidation charges for allegedly threatening two county judges and a police officer.

Fifty-seven-year-old Alan Dale Krontz was arrested Tuesday by State Police detectives on three counts of intimidation. He remained jailed Wednesday at the Steuben County Jail.

Online court records don’t list an attorney for Krontz. Prosecutors allege that the rural Angola man made threatening telephone calls early Saturday to the homes of DeKalb County judges Kevin Wallace and Monte Brown.

He allegedly spoke to the judges’ wives and told them their husbands’ lives may be in danger, placing them “in fear of retaliation for a prior lawful act.” The threatening calls were reported to Auburn police.

Krontz allegedly made a similar call on or about August 12 to Butler police Officer Jared Stamper.
