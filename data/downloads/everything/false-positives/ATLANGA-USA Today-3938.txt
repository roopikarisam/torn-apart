Atlanta Hawks small forward DeAndre’ Bembry was arrested and charged with reckless driving and speeding on Friday morning, according to the Atlanta Journal Constitution.


Bembry’s purple Dodge Charger was clocked at 128 MPH in a 55 MPH zone just past midnight, Atlanta police officer Donald Hannah told the AJC.


He was booked in the Atlanta City Detention Center, according to the outlet, and was later released on cash bond.


"We are aware of an incident involving DeAndre’ Bembry earlier this morning,” the Hawks said in a statement. “We are still gathering information as it pertains to the situation, and out of respect for the legal process, we will have no further comment at this time.”


Bembry, a second-year forward, is averaging 4.8 points and 2.3 rebounds this season.
