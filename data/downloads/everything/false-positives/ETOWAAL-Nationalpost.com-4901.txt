GADSDEN, Ala. — An Alabama youth evangelist arrested last week on charges of sexually abusing children was back in jail Tuesday on additional charges, authorities said.


Paul Edmond Acton Bowen, 37, of Southside is accused of abusing four juveniles between the ages of 12 and 17 for years, according to a statement from the Etowah County Sheriff’s Department.


Bowen, a youth speaker who has written three books and operated Acton Bowen Outreach, was charged with felony sodomy and enticing a child for immoral purposes, plus misdemeanour sexual abuse. Authorities said some victims are adults and were just reporting what happened.


Bowen was jailed in Etowah County with bail set at $500,000. He was released on bond last week following his initial arrest on similar charges.


Bowen has released a statement denying any inappropriate conduct, and his lawyer, Richard Jaffe, said “unsubstantiated rumours” that spread over the last few days had materialized.


“Acton, until last week, enjoyed an unblemished national and statewide reputation for spreading the gospel and helping those in need. He continues to weather the storm,” Jaffe said.








Court records show his wife filed for divorce last week following his first arrest. The two married in 2015 and have no children, court files showed.
