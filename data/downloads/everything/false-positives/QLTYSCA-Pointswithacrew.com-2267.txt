Recently I was attending StirTrek, a one day tech conference in Columbus Ohio.  Even though I don’t live too far from Columbus, because I was going up the night before for an associated board game night, I ended up staying at the Marriott TownePlace Suites Columbus Airport hotel and I thought I would do a TownePlace Suites Columbus Airport Gahanna review.  While I know reviews of these types of “random” hotels are not as “sexy” as reviews of 5 star hotels in exotic locations, I feel like authentic hotel reviews of places can help fellow travelers know what to expect.  After all, most families aren’t going to be looking for or staying in 5 star hotels for their vacations.  And while Marriott does a better job of enforcing brand quality and consistency than some other chains (Choice, I’m lookin at you!), it still can be good to know what to look for

The TownePlace Suites Columbus Airport Gahanna is located (strangely enough 😀 ) near John Glenn Columbus Airport (CMH), on the east side of Columbus.  The address is 695 Taylor Road, Columbus, Ohio 43230, and it is quite close to either Exit 37 or Exit 39 from I-270.  It is also convenient to the Easton Town Center which is one of the largest shopping complexes in the Midwest.



The TownePlace Suites Columbus Airport Gahanna is actually located right next to a Springhill Suites (also a Marriott).  So if you’re coming east on Taylor Road (from I-270), you’ll pass the Springhill Suites first and then see the Towne Place Suites Columbus Airport.

There are 2 different buildings – if you’re looking at the property from the road, registration / check-in is in the building to your left



The Gahanna Marriott TownePlaceSuites is a Category 3 Marriott hotel, which for now costs 15,000 Marriott points / night.  Cash rates depend on the day of course but run about $100. My out the door price was $109.82 for 1 night.

You can check current hotel rates at hotels.com or of course on the hotel website itself.

The rooms (suites) at the Marriott TownePlace Suites Columbus Airport were quite large and comfortable.  It wasn’t a suite in the sense that it had a room with a closing door (like you might find in a Residence Inn), but it was definitely larger than your typical hotel room



The Marriott TownePlace Suites Columbus Airport suite had a full kitchen with refrigerator, microwave, dishwasher, stovetop AND an oven, making it perfect if you have an extended stay and want to cut down on food costs.



The bathroom was fairly small but functional and bright



The Marriott TownePlace Suites Columbus Airport does have a small outdoor pool, which was closed when I was there (early May)



There is coin laundry available on-site (not pictured) as well as what the hotel website claims is a “state-of-the-art fitness room”.



Now I don’t know that I’d call that “state of the art” 😀 but it definitely had the needed equipment for most casual exercisers.

One other interesting hotel amenity at the Marriott TownePlace Suites Columbus Airport was that it listed a series of items that they have available for borrowing.



I have to say, I highly prefer this model over the Hyatt Place “charge you for everything” model.  One amusing note – the board game night we were participating ended at 10pm and there were a few of us that were interested in continuing to play.  Remembering this sign, I suggested that we could head back to the hotel and play one of the board games there.  The suggestion was outvoted, which ended up being for the best as the next morning I inquired what board games they had available and was told it was only “Monopoly, Scrabble and Sorry”.  Apparently the Marriott TownePlace Suites Gahanna Columbus Airport has not realized that the state of boardgames has advanced in the past 30 years 😀

TownePlace Suites are one of the few Marriott hotels that offer free breakfast, to all guests.  The breakfast area was fairly small, but there were not a ton of people there at least when I stopped by.



The breakfast had your traditional continental breakfast items





as well as 2 hot items



On the day I was there it was pork sausage and fried eggs with cracked pepper, which I was not a huge fan of.  I assume that they rotate the hot items from day to day.

All in all, my stay at the Marriott TownePlace Suites Columbus Airport Gahanna was enjoyable and I would stay there again.  As a reminder, you can read other reviews at TripAdvisor, check current hotel rates at hotels.com or of course on the hotel website itself.
