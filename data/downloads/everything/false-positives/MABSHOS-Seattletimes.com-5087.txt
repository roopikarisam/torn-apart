GROTON, Mass. (AP) — A recent college graduate charged with fatally beating his mother, grandparents and their caretaker with a baseball bat in Massachusetts has been found competent to stand trial.

Twenty-two-year-old Orion Krause has completed a 40-day mental health evaluation, but he will remain at Bridgewater State Hospital. He is charged with four counts of murder and has pleaded not guilty.

Judge Margaret Guzman ordered Friday that records of the mental health evaluation remain sealed.

Edward Wayland, Krause’s attorney, said he asked for his client to be kept at Bridgewater to help ensure he continues to receive his medications and treatment.

Krause was naked and covered in mud and cuts when officers found him at a neighbor’s house, according to the documents.

Authorities say Krause told officers he “freed them.”
