Derek Carr's return to action is on hold.

Raiders coach Jack Del Rio told reporters Monday that his star quarterback is dealing with a transverse process fracture in his back.

"There's a real good chance he'll miss this week," Del Rio said of Carr's status for Sunday's clash with the Ravens, noting that the signal-caller's time on the shelf "could be as short as two weeks."

 
    


A back injury of this nature typically comes with a two-to-six-week recovery period. It's worth noting this is the same injury that plagued Tony Romo with the Cowboys back in 2014.

Carr left Sunday's 16-10 loss Denver during the third quarter after being hit by a pair of Broncos defenders on his way to the ground. After a visit to the medical tent, the fourth-year starter walked to the locker room and did not return.

"I tried to come in here and have them work on it. I tried to throw and all those kind of things and it just wasn't ready yet," Carr told reporters after the game. "I tried to do anything I could to be back out there. I just couldn't."

Carr's absence in Week 5 would tee up former Bills first-round pick EJ Manuel to face the Ravens after going 11 of 17 for 106 yards with a pick in his relief effort against Denver.

It's a thorny development for a Raiders team sitting at 2-2 after a pair of concerning performances on offense. Marshawn Lynch has been up-and-down on the ground and Michael Crabtree missed Week 4 with an injury, while fellow receiver Amari Cooper was held in check all day.

Carr's return can't come soon with the Raiders set to play the Chargers in Week 6 and Chiefs in Week 7, two division rivals, before squaring off with the upstart Bills. It's not clear -- not yet -- if he'll be available for any of those contests.
