FARGO, N.D. (AP) â€” A federal district court magistrate has dismissed lawsuits filed by four inmates over the food at the Cass County Jail.

In the first case filed in 2016, three Muslim inmates said they were intentionally and secretly fed pork after they notified jail officials it was a violation of their religious beliefs. KVRR reports the jail had actually modified its menu in 2015 to eliminate all pork products.

The second case was filed by a fourth inmate this past fall and had the same claim.

Jail officials say they respect the religious rights of all inmates and are pleased the lawsuits have been dismissed.
