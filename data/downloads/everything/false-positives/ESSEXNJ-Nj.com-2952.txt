A 35-year-old Newark woman has been charged with murder in the fatal stabbing of her boyfriend, authorities said Wednesday.

Norma Vasquez, 35, had originally been charged with the aggravated assault Sunday of Ricardo Valla, 34, the Essex County Prosecutor's Office said. 

Vasquez's charges were upgraded after Valla was pronounced dead on Monday at University Hospital, Acting Prosecutor Robert D. Laurino and city Public Safety Director Anthony F. Ambrose said in a joint statement.

Records show Vasquez remains jailed at the Essex County Correctional Facility.

The prosecutor's office said the investigation into Valla's death is active and ongoing, and asked anyone with information to call its homicide/major crimes tips line at 1-877-TIPS-4EC or 1-877-847-7432.
