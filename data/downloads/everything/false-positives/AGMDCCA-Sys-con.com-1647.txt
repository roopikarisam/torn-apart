SPRING HOPE, NC -- (Marketwired) -- 09/21/17 -- Hemp, Inc. (OTC PINK: HEMP) is pleased to announce that it has signed an agreement, formalizing a venture with One Step Vending, Corp. (OTC PINK: KOSK), a holding company focused on the acquisition of market-changing and disruptive business models, with an emphasis on the self-serve vending market. Per the agreement, Hemp, Inc. will create unique hemp oil-based consumer products specifically for sale through One Step Vending, Corp.'s approved, existing micro markets, or kiosks around the country. Hemp, Inc., a global leader in the industrial hemp industry with the largest hemp processing facility and mill in the western hemisphere, will also provide general industry specific business guidance at the public level to One Step Vending, Corp.




"One Step Vending, Corp. is bringing real business solutions to the vending industry with its micro-markets that are displacing traditional vending machines. We are excited to create unique hemp oil-based products specifically for One Step Vending, Corp. and providing our expertise in producing and manufacturing both industrial and consumer hemp oil-based products," said Bruce Perlowin, CEO of Hemp, Inc. "Ultimately, this partnership will lead to increased consumer access of hemp oil-based products via self-serve kiosks in corporate offices around the country. This is a very unique distribution channel that will contribute to the exploding CBD market which is expected to hit $2.1 billion in consumer sales by 2020. By Hemp, Inc. being entrenched in the industrial hemp sector, with the largest operational multipurpose industrial hemp processing facility in the western hemisphere, we have the ability to accommodate consumer demand as the CBD market explodes. Thus, there are huge economic opportunities for One Step Vending, Corp. and Hemp, Inc."




Hemp, Inc. and One Step Vending, Corp. are currently collaborating on project plans, including product design, costs, timeline and legalities.




"Cannabinoid (CBD) is a natural constituent of the hemp plant and has been shown to have positive health benefits, without causing negative psychoactive effects. We believe this partnership with Hemp, Inc. will enable us to create a powerhouse on the distribution side of CBD products and allow us to meet the high demand for hemp oil-based products. Hemp, Inc. is a pioneer in the hemp industry so we have no doubt that we will be able to deliver on our goal of creating a distribution powerhouse by expanding our product mix," said Daniel Garfinkel, CEO of One Step Vending, Corp.




According to a One Step Vending, Corp. rep, a kiosk will be on display at the upcoming Hemp University educational symposium on Saturday, September 30, 2017 from 8:30am - 5:00pm. The event will be held at the Peachtree Hills Country Club, 3512 Peachtree Hills Road, Spring Hope, NC 27882. The Hemp Oil Event (The Art &amp; Science of CBD Oil) is the Hemp University's 4th educational symposium. The almost sold out event will bring attendees up to speed on all business and scientific aspects of Industrial Hemp CBD cannabinoids by disseminating current, reliable information that continues to shape the revolutionary CBD market.




"Our strategic alliance with One Step Vending Corp. is just the beginning of a lot of great things to come," concluded Perlowin.




HEMP, INC.'S NORTH CAROLINA INDUSTRIAL HEMP HUB
Hemp, Inc.'s 70,000 square foot industrial hemp processing facility, on over 9 acres in Spring Hope, North Carolina, is the only one of this magnitude in the western hemisphere. It is indeed bound to become the mecca of this new clean green agricultural and industrial American revolution. Based on a variety of factors, Perlowin believes North Carolina is strategically positioned to be the largest hemp producing state in America by 2018. However, Kentucky and West Virginia will join this industrial hemp hub along with Virginia, Pennsylvania, New York, Tennessee, South Carolina, and Georgia. Most of these states were historically considered the hemp hub of America and will be again this time next year.

ABOUT THE "HEMP GROWING, CBD PRODUCING VETERAN VILLAGE KINS COMMUNITIES"
Aligned with Hemp, Inc.'s Triple Bottom Line approach, CEO Bruce Perlowin is exploring the possibilities of developing "Hemp Growing, CBD Producing Veteran Village Kins Communities" in North Carolina, Florida, Kentucky and several other states similar to the 500-acre demonstration community being built in Arizona. He currently has 4,500 acres (and counting) of land north of Kingman, Arizona where he's building a Veteran Village on 500 of those acres that would consist of 160 lots of 2 1/2 acre parcels for Kins Domains (eco-villages). Each parcel would grow 1 acre of hemp as well as having organic gardens, natural beehives, a pond, a living fence and other elements that make up a Kins Domain.




An additional 100 acres of hemp will be grown in each one of these 500-acre communities which will also include a 100,000 square-foot hemp (CBD) processing facility and a 10 acre holistic and learning center designed to treat and retrain veterans. The revenue from fifty of those acres is used to support that community. The revenue from the other fifty acres of hemp will be used to purchase 2 additional 500-acre parcels of land, thus keeping up with the needs of a large number of veterans that exist now and in the future. The eco-friendly "Veteran Village Kins Communities" were inspired by the book series, The Ringing Cedars of Russia (https://www.ringingcedars.com).




Perlowin has since found a way to incorporate it into Hemp, Inc.'s strategy of building hemp growing, CBD-producing "communities" or "villages." The first part of these "Veteran Village Kins Communities" is a "holistic healing and learning center" whose function in each community is to treat, train and re-train our veterans. The prototype Veteran Village Kins Community in Arizona is expected to be completed by late 2017.




Perlowin has been personally creating the Arizona "Veteran Village Kins Community" since 2013 as a solution to America's multifaceted veteran problem. To date, forty-four percent of America's homeless are veterans. Twelve percent of that group are combat woman veterans with children. Twenty-two veterans commit suicide EVERY DAY. Two million veterans are on food stamps. As for the future, 238,000 veterans are leaving the armed services every year, according to Dannion Brinkley, Chairman of the Twilight Brigade.




From rehabilitation to job creation, Perlowin says this model presents a comprehensive holistic solution to those individuals that all Americans owe a great debt of gratitude toward the American veterans. Perlowin expects this model to produce very lucrative revenue for Hemp, Inc., the veterans themselves and the local communities these Kins Communities are built near. "The infrastructure for 'The Hemp Growing, CBD-Producing, Veteran-Village Kins Community,' which takes time to build, is already in place in Arizona. I've been building this infrastructure since 2013 and it can be duplicated for any state," says Perlowin.

IN THE NEWS: HEMP ON TRACK FOR LEGALIZATION
North Carolina: Editorial, "Here's Another way North Carolina is out-hustling Virginia" talks about North Carolina's top hemp advocate on "how this (industrial hemp) genetic offshoot of marijuana is such a versatile crop that farmers can make money three ways off the same plant -- the seeds can be used for food, the pods for nutritional supplements, the stalks used for fiber." "It's a no-brainer thing for farmers," Bob Crumley says." He talks about how growing hemp was once considered a patriotic act. In colonial times, farmers were required to plant a certain number of acres of hemp -- or pay higher taxes. The first drafts of the Declaration of Independence were written on hemp paper. Betsy Ross's flag was made out of hemp. Hemp was the "America First" economic policy of its day, because the fibrous plant enabled the colonies to be self-reliant in everything from canvas for ships' sails to uniforms. Read the full editorial here.
Utah: A Utah agricultural board has given preliminary approval to a change in government rules that would allow farmers in the state to cultivate industrial hemp for research purposes. Farmers would be allowed to grow hemp that contains less than 0.03% THC under the Utah Department of Food and Agriculture's proposed rule. State research institutions such as Utah State University are already allowed to cultivate industrial hemp for research purposes as part of the 2014 federal Farm Bill, but the new rule would expand who's allowed to grow the plant, the Salt Lake Tribune reported. Read the full article here.




Nevada: Gov. Sandoval signed Senate Bill 375 and Senate Bill 396 recently, allowing Nevada's Native American tribal government to directly negotiate with the state over the use and sale of medicinal cannabis on tribal lands, and expanding the state's hemp cultivation program. According to the article, Gov. Sandoval also gave the proverbial green light by signing off on Senate Bill 396. The recently passed legislation creates an additional hemp program for Nevada's farmers. Per the bill, S.B. 396 establishes rules and regulations authorizing the growth and handling of industrial hemp for the production of cannabinoid-infused products.




Colorado: Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper signed off on Senate Bill 17-117, entitled "Recognize Industrial Hemp Agricultural Product for Agricultural Water Right," on May 21, 2017. This bill protects hemp farmers who use water stored in federal reservoirs. The bill was introduced in the state Legislature by Sen. Don Coram, and sponsored by Rep. Marc Catlin. Both are Montrose Republicans. Colorado legalized growing hemp in 2014, but it is still banned at the federal level, creating complications when water from a federal project is used to water it. Senate Bill 17-117 says Colorado water right holders have the right to use it on hemp if the person is registered by the state to grow hemp for commercial, or research purposes. During an interview with The Journal, Hickenlooper said the hemp water bill will give farmers some reassurance, and he was cautiously optimistic that it could become a good cash crop for the state.




"Concerning confirmation that industrial hemp is a recognized agricultural product for which a person with a water right decreed for agricultural use may use the water subject to the water right for industrial hemp cultivation. In Colorado, water subject to a water right may be used for the purpose for which the water is decreed. The bill confirms that a person with an absolute or conditional water right decreed for agricultural use may use the water subject to the water right for the growth or cultivation of industrial hemp if the person is registered by the department of agriculture to grow industrial hemp for commercial or research and development purposes."

North Dakota: Chris Zenker, one of 35 farmers and growers who received a special license from the North Dakota Department of Agriculture to grow industrial hemp for 2017, drove from Gackle to a farm just north of Carrington, North Dakota last week to pick up enough industrial hemp seed to plant 100 acres. According to Zenker, he is trying hemp as a way to introduce a different crop in the rotation and likes that it has the potential to be a cash crop. The seed from Gussiaas' farm received the largest of four shipments of industrial hemp seed, 64,000 pounds, that the North Dakota Department of Agriculture had shipped from Canada for distribution to farmers and growers approved to grow hemp in 2017. The state will receive a total of 84,250 pounds of industrial hemp seed this year with seed distributed in 50-pound bags. (visit full article on www.agweek.com)




Illinois: The Illinois Senate unanimously approved a measure, SB 1294, that would allow farmers to grow and sell industrial hemp, a strain of cannabis. But unlike marijuana, industrial hemp contains less than one percent of THC, and its fiber can be used to manufacture a variety of products. Pollitt says he estimates Illinois stands to gain an economic industry, including processing and transportation, that could outpace the state's pumpkin crop. Hemp advocates point to neighboring Kentucky, where more than 135 farms and 40 processors have enrolled in the state's pilot program that launched in 2016.




The Industrial Hemp Senate Bill 1294 was passed to the House on May 5, 2017. On May 31, 2017, final action for the House was extended to June 30, 2017. As of 7/6/2017, this Bill was re-referred to the Rules Committee.




West Virginia: In West Virginia, Governor Jim Justice signed House Bill 2453 which allows hemp to be grown for research purposes, to also allow hemp to be grown commercially. The proposal was passed by both the House and Senate unanimously. HB 2453 states that a person growing industrial hemp for commercial purposes shall apply to the commissioner for license on a form prescribed by the commissioner. The application for a license must include the name and address of the applicant and the legal description of the land area to be used for the production of industrial hemp.




Whether it's Alaska or Florida, North Carolina or Nevada, Hemp, Inc. is on the ground more often than not conducting business in those states. In Arizona, for example, Hemp, Inc. plans to grow up to 300 acres on a 500-acre Veteran Village Kins Community as soon as Arizona legalizes hemp, which we expect in early 2018. "Hemp, Inc. does not wait for the inevitable legalization of industrial hemp in a state prior to building our industrial hemp infrastructure there. Instead of waiting for it to be legalized, being proactive gives us a significant advantage in the industrial hemp industry," says Perlowin.




Florida: In Florida, Gov. Rick Scott signed the Industrial Hemp Pilot Projects bill into law. The bill would give FAMU Florida A&amp;M University and UF University of Florida the green light to develop pilot projects to cultivate, process, test, research, create and market safe commercial applications for industrial hemp. According to the article, "the universities would work with private partnerships to conduct and pay for the research. All research would be registered with Florida's Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services. Approval for the program is needed by the universities' board of trustees." If approved by trustees, the universities are required to submit a report to the governor and the Legislature within two years after the pilot project's creation.




In August, 2017, Perlowin plans to buy land in Florida to build a Veteran's Village Kins Community in that state.




WHAT IS HEMP?
Hemp is a durable natural fiber that is grown as a renewable source for raw materials that can be incorporated into thousands of products. It's one of the oldest domesticated crops known to man. Hemp is used in nutritional food products such as hemp seeds, hemp hearts and hemp proteins, for humans. It is also used in building materials, paper, textiles, cordage, organic body care and other nutraceuticals, just to name a few. It has thousands of other known uses. A hemp crop requires half the water alfalfa uses and can be grown without the heavy use of pesticides. Farmers worldwide grow hemp commercially for fiber, seed, and oil for use in a variety of industrial and consumer products. The United States is the only developed nation that fails to cultivate industrial hemp as an economic crop on a large scale, according to the Congressional Resource Service. However, with rapidly changing laws and more states gravitating towards industrial hemp and passing an industrial hemp bill, that could change. Currently, the majority of hemp sold in the United States is imported from China and Canada, the world's largest exporters of the industrial hemp crop.

9 GREAT REASONS TO INCLUDE HEMP AS PART OF A HEALTHY DIET (Source)




HOW HEMP CAN CHANGE THE WORLD
Fuel -- While the industrial, medicinal and commercial properties of hemp have been known to mankind for a very long time, its benefits to the environment have just been realized in recent years. One of the compelling things hemp offers is fuel. Reserves of petroleum are being depleted. Right now we are depleting our reserves of petroleum and buying it up from other countries. It would be nice if we could have a fuel source which was reusable and which we could grow right here, making us completely energy independent.




Industries in search of sustainable and eco-friendly processes are realizing hemp as a viable option. Hemp can provide an alternative, more efficient source of energy in the fuel industry. "The woody hemp plant is low in moisture; it dries quickly and is an efficient biomass source of methanol. The waste products produced by using hemp oil are a good source of ethanol. Both methanol and ethanol are produced from hemp through the efficient and economical process of thermo-chemical conversion. One acre of hemp yields 1,000 gallons or 3,785 liters of fuel. Hemp allows a lesser reliance on fossil fuels, which are non-renewable sources of energy and will not be able to meet the increasing global demands for long."




Petroleum fuel increases carbon monoxide in the atmosphere and contributes heavily to global warming and the greenhouse effect, which could lead to global catastrophe in the next 50 years if these trends continue. Do you want to find out if they are right, or do you want to grow the most cost effective and environmentally safe fuel source on the planet? Using hemp as an energy and rotation crop would be a great step in the right direction.
