BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) â€” A New York woman has been sentenced to three years in prison for biting off a man's ear.

Erie County District Attorney John Flynn says Chris Orgovan, of Buffalo, got into an argument with the man on June 11. He says she bit his right ear, detaching part of it.

When police arrived at the home, an officer found the ear and members of the Buffalo Fire Department preserved it. The ear was later reattached by surgeons.

Orgovan pleaded guilty to second-degree assault in August.
