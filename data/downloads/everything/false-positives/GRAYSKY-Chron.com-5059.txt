Country music artist, Randy Travis' DWI naked arrest video was officially released after Texas judge Sam Sparks denied Travis' request to keep it private.

The singer was arrested in 2012 after a crash. When police arrived on the scene, they found Travis was naked and likely intoxicated.

After his arrest, Travis went to court and filed a lawsuit in September 2017 to try to keep the video from going public, claiming it was a violation of his privacy rights.

The lawsuit said the footage, which according to legal records show him nude and disorientated and making threats to the officers, were highly embarrassing and intimate and inappropriate to release in light of the fact that Travis "can no longer speak cogently and is not even in the position to discuss, let alone defend, his previous actions."
