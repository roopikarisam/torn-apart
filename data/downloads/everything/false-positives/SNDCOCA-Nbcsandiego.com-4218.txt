Nine people were arrested in a warrant sweep Saturday by the San Diego County Sheriff's Department (SDSO) in the South County region.


The suspects were apprehended in the cities of Imperial Beach, National City and the unincorporated areas of Bonita and Lincoln Acres with outstanding warrants, "regardless of charge or bail amount," sheriff's Sgt. David Pocklington said.


Deputies cleared 10 misdemeanor warrants as part of the sweep and one of the arrestees was charged with a new felony for possession of a controlled substance while on jail grounds, he said.


The sweep was funded by the Sheriff's Warrant Automation Trust Fund, which was made up of fees collected from people who failed to appear in court or failed to comply with a court order.


The Sheriff's Department will continue to conduct these warrant sweeps, Pocklingtons said.
