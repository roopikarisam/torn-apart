PORTSMOUTH, Va. (AP) — A 25-year-old inmate at the Hampton Roads Regional Jail has died while being treated at a hospital.

Jail officials tell local media Tameka Simpson of Norfolk died Wednesday morning at Bon Secours Maryview Medical Center in Portsmouth.

Jail spokeswoman Zakkiyya Anderson tells the Virginian-Pilot Simpson was taken to the jail with pre-existing medical conditions last July. Anderson says the regional jail often receives transfer inmates from local jails who have a mental illness or acute medical issues.

Citing confidentiality laws, jail officials say they can’t release any details on the conditions.

The medical examiner will determine Simpson’s cause of death. Portsmouth police are investigating.
