The life of a professional fighter isn't all glitz and glamour. 

As if getting punched, kicked, kneed, choked and twisted into a pretzel on a regular basis isn't enough, fighters attract a general wackiness that makes their lives, well...interesting.

To commemorate these day-to-day hardships, slip-ups, pranks, and more, we bring you, "The Weekly Grind."

 This was a really cool experience! Love my furry friends ! They’re savages ! #MilitaryDogs #WarDogs #MyDawgs #IStuffedTheSecondTakedown #TheirTeethWentThroughTheSuit

 Saturday night doc viewing.  @thenotoriousmma NOTORIOUS.  Great insight into the DNA of this successful and smart business man.  Best part of his success, is when you strip it all away - it will always come down to being the hardest worker in the room.  Those roots never go away.  Solid doc. Well done brother.

 I want to first thank Amanda @abcnation115 Cooper for taking the fight against me this Saturday at UFC224. How most of you know, I missed weight and thankfully, Amanda and the UFC allowed the fight to happen. I know was unprofessional and I truley didn’t mean any disrespect to my opponent, organization or the fans. I really learned a lot from this and I know this is just making me a better fighter/athlete for the future. I appreciate all the messages and support from all of you and I can say that everything is already in the works with the help of the UFC to make sure this doesn’t happen again. • • •  Primeiramente quero agradecer Amanda Cooper por aceitar a luta contra mim  sábado passado no UFC224. Como a maioria de vcs sabem, eu não bati o peso, e graças a Amanda e o UFC, a luta ainda aconteceu. Eu sei que foi antiprofissional e em momento algum eu queria desrespeitar minha adversária, a organização e os fãs. Eu aprendi muito com isso e sei que isso está fazendo eu me tornar uma lutadora/atleta melhor para o futuro. Eu agradeço todooo mundo pelas mensagens e apoio e posso confirmar que tudo já está em ordem com o UFC para que isso nunca mais aconteça.   @marcelogoncalves.photo

Well this is a big fat slap in the face. I’ve fought top competition, beat #14 and the rankings finally grace me with #15 ranking, just to get bumped by a fucking Flyweight. pic.twitter.com/ZYlP5Ogs6w

 I’m going to weigh in on the @ufc #strawweight rankings with at least 7.5lbs of factual perspective: 1- For the most part 1-5 are pretty accurate across all weight divisions, but after that the rankings are a crap shoot. 2- These days hype trains seem to be gifted rankings over actually having to fight to the top. 3- #McenzieDern misses weight by 7.5 pounds, which makes her closer to a #Flyweight than strawweight. She beats an unranked fighter and takes @angieoverkill well earned #15 spot when her only actual win in the ufc as a #straweight was to #Ashleyyoder. McEnzie won by a very close split decision, while Angela won unanimously. So why does Angela get bumped?? 4- Justine Kish isn’t even in the top 15, although she beat #14 #NinaAnsaroff unanimously and #11 #RandaMarkos. Justine did move up to Flyweight but so did #calderwood. So why is Calderwood even in the rankings anymore? 5- If #waterson is #7 &amp; I’m #8 then 9,10 &amp; 11 are all out of order… 6- I beat #Grasso unanimous decision , I beat #casey split. Waterson beats casey split decision. Casey finishes Markos, while Grasso takes her to split. So the rankings should actually be:  #7 Waterson #8 Herrig #9 Casey  #10 Grasso  #11 Markos  Even if Dern made weigh there is no factual reasoning as to why or how she could take Angela’s spot other than a massive glitch in the matrix. LBD out!

Old Chuck has been calling me out for years! I get it, I hold pretty much every record in the division. I normally try to respect my elders but if you want it come get it. Id literally fly you out to Albuquerque this weekend.

You might want to test the strength of that jaw before you take a bite you cant chew

In all seriousness @ChuckLiddell I appreciate your offer for a fight, but due to scheduling conflicts may not be able to fulfill till mid 2019 .In the Upcoming months I have similarly lethal opponents in Ric Flair and George Foreman awaiting .

i’m done with all this Internet bullshit for the time being, if you have something else to say to me I’ve already invited you down to Albuquerque. Take care old man Ladelle pic.twitter.com/vf1bhXqTdK

You’re fighting all pussies, handpicked by the Ufc for your bitch ass. Fight a top 6 guy see how you do. Test yourself don’t fight easy fights

Ice your pussy... and your padded competition. And send me a tie die shirt so I can wipe my ass with it thanks

I sold more shirts than you have followers . You are concussed and your chin is shot, brotha .

You bought all the shirts , you bought all the followers. Let’s be honest

 With the intention to be as honest as I can be with my fans and specially with my opponent, I will go straight to the point. The injured that happened with me during the training camp somehow made the news. My team nor I had mentioned before, during or after the fight. Winning or losing, fighting injured or not; it is part of an athlete’s life. I’m not the first one nor will be the last one athlete to fight injured. Even though all the limitations imposed to me because of the injured I suffered. It is my decision to step into the octagon or not. And I decided to do it! I did not want to miss the chance to have my last fight at the UFC; in my country, my hometown and with a such respected opponent. I gave my best on the fight and my opponent was the better man that night. And this is what counts! Nothing that happened with me during the training camp takes anything away from his victory. Of course wasn’t the outcome I wished for. Not because of the defeat, because we can’t control the outcome. What bothers me is knowing that I performed bellow of what I know that I can. I literally grew up in the cage, I was wrought to be a fighter, to leave it all in the cage... and this teachings I brought to all the aspects of my life. Dedicated every minute, every second doing the best you can in whatever you’re committed to. To the ones genuinely concerned with me, I will tell you this: I feel like an injured Lion. To the haters and envious, I will tell you this: I might be injured, BUT I’M STILL A LION! See you all very soon...
