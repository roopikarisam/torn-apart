ROCKBRIDGE COUNTY, Va. (WDBJ7) -- A man wanted on kidnapping charges in Connecticut was arrested near Lexington Wednesday night, after leading deputies on a chase across county lines.

Rockbridge County Sheriff's officials say they spotted David Allen Irwin driving near Walmart around 7 p.m.

Deputies say they followed him and tried to pull him over.

They say he then sped off into Botetourt County and then eventually back into Rockbridge County. Virginia State Police temporarily halted the pursuit for public safety when Irwin began driving very aggressively,

Lexington police were able to deflate his tires near Natural Bridge and pulled him over a few miles down the interstate.

Irwin, 49, is in jail awaiting extradition to Connecticut and also faces local charges for felony eluding and multiple counts of reckless driving.

The Buena Vista Police Department and Botetourt County Sheriff's Office also assisted in this pursuit.
