A 21-year-old man was arrested early Thursday after authorities say he crashed a minivan into a house in Cedar Hills, injuring two of his passengers.

Ezana Tedros of Manteca, California was booked into the Washington County Jail on suspicion of driving under the influence of intoxicants, second-degree criminal mischief and fourth-degree assault. No one inside the house was injured.

According to the county sheriff's office, the silver 2016 Honda Odyssey went off road around 1:35 a.m., hit a tree, spun around and careened backwards into a house in the 10700 block of Southwest Walker Road.

Tedros' 24- and 21-year-old passengers sustained non-life-threatening injuries.
