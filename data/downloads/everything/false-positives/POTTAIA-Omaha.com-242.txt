Council Bluffs police took a 45-year-old Bluffs man into custody after someone threatened to come into a business and shoot the people inside.

Officers were dispatched to Arrow Towing at 505 S. 15th St. at about 10:50 a.m. Thursday after they were notified of the threat. They then were told that the man who made the threat was at the Perfect Stay Inn at 802 Veterans Memorial Highway.

As officers arrived at that address, they were told that the man had just fled from the hotel. Officers contacted nearby Heartland Christian School, which police said was put on lockout, meaning no one is allowed in or out.

Officers used a police dog to track the man who fled. He was found in a ditch about three-fourths of a mile northeast of the hotel. Police took the man to the Pottawattamie County Jail. They said they didnâ€™t find a weapon.

Larry Gray, executive director of Heartland Christian School, said the lockout was in effect nearly two hours. After about 35 minutes into the lockout, he said, students and parents were allowed to enter and exit the building as long as a law enforcement officer was present.
