TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) — Arizona authorities are seeking a drug trafficker found guilty last week of transporting 8.5 pounds (3.85 kilograms) of methamphetamine.

State Attorney General Mark Brnovich on Thursday asked the public to be on the lookout for Antonio Quintero-Ayon, who was also convicted of conspiracy and conducting a criminal enterprise.

Mia Garcia, spokeswoman for the Arizona Attorney General’s Office, says Quintero-Ayon jumped bond before his trial and law enforcement hasn’t been able to find him.

Garcia says a trooper from the Arizona Department of Public Safety arrested Quintero-Ayon during a Nov. 28, 2016, traffic stop after finding more than $25,000 worth of methamphetamine in his vehicle.

Quintero-Ayon was released from Pima County Jail later that day after posting a $10,000 bond.
