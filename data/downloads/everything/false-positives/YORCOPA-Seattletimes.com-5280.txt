WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) â€” Two real estate developers will be calling prison their home after a scheme to pay bribes to falsely register voters and install development-friendly officials in a New York village.

Authorities say Shalom Lamm and Kenneth Nakdimen worked to corrupt the electoral process in Bloomingburg, New York.

Acting U.S. Attorney Joon H. Kim says Lamm got a 10-month sentence on Thursday. He says Nakdimen was sentenced in September to six months in prison.

The prosecution stemmed from a March 2014 election for the office of mayor and other jobs in the Sullivan County village of about 420 residents.

The plan failed to corral enough votes to win approval for residential real estate projects that would have boosted the population by thousands.
