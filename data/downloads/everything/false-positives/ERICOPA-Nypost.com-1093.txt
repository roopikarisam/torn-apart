Freeze!

Upstate cops are so fed up with this year’s seemingly never-ending winter that they’ve placed the frigid season “under arrest.”

The Depew Police Department in Erie County demanded that Old Man Winter get lost or face jail time in a Facebook spoof posted Friday.

“Dear Winter, You are hereby placed under arrest. You have the right to remain silent and out of sight,” the department wrote with a wink. “Any further snow you produce will be held against you in a court of law.”

The cops also called for Old Man Winter to turn in groundhog Punxsutawney Phil for predicting six more weeks of winter.

“You have the right to an attorney, but only if you turn in the groundhog that predicted six more weeks of winter. If you are willing to work with us, we are willing to look past your most recent transgressions over the course of this past week. The choice is yours,” the post says.

New York has been slammed with annoyingly late wintry weather this month, including high winds that caused power outages.
