ORANGE COUNTY, Va. (CBS19 NEWS) --  A couple in Orange County will not spend any more time in jail for the death of a four-year-old boy who was in their care at the time.

Last May, Cole Clark found a gun and accidentally shot himself while was in child care at Heather Massey's home in Orange County.

Nicholas Stoia, who was not home at the time of the incident, owned the gun that Cole found.

He was also in training to be a sheriff's deputy in Stafford County.

Massey was convicted of child cruelty, and Stoia was convicted of reckless handling of a gun.

In court on Thursday, they were both sentenced to time already served.

The prosecutor said she was disappointed because she had hoped for a bigger punishment and she believed this sentence brings little comfort to Cole's parents.
