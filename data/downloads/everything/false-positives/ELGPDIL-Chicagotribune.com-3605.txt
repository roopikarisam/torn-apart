The city of Elgin will hold a June 2 “community conversation” on police issues, including the process through which the Illinois State Police are investigating the Elgin police shooting death DeCynthia Clements nearly three months ago.


“Our goal is to provide a welcoming environment where people can feel heard,” Deputy Police Chief Bill Wolf said. “While the investigation is expected to last several months, we will continue dialog in the interim. We are committed to continue learning from the community about areas we can improve and will take action to make our department even better.”


The event, hosted by the Clergy Coalition of Elgin in partnership with the city and police department, will be held from 9 to 11 a.m. in the Heritage Ballroom at The Centre of Elgin, 100 Symphony Way.


Clements was shot March 12 after Elgin police pulled her over on westbound Interstate 90 near Elgin. Officers spent more than hour trying to persuade Clements to leave her SUV when the 32-year-old Elgin woman set her vehicle on fire and exited with a knife in her hand, according to police reports. She was shot three times by Lt. Christian Jensen and later died at an Elgin hospital.


Police don’t expect to release any new information about the case during the public discussion, but they will be able to provide a general timeframe for the investigation, explain the role of each government agency involved in the process and what the potential next steps might be depending on the investigation findings, Wolf said.


In addition to walking through every step in the investigative process, police will also discuss how complaints about the department are handled, he said.


There will be small group discussions and the public will have a chance to ask questions and share their thoughts on policing in Elgin.


The event is expected to be attended by members of the Elgin City Council, the Elgin Police Department, staff from the city manager’s office, clergy and other community leaders.

Wolf said there will be 10 police officers present, and he will be leading their part of the discussion.


For those who cannot attend the discussion, the presentation and a log of questions asked at the meeting and subsequent answers will be posted on the city’s website.


Elgin Mayor Dave Kaptain said city officials know residents have questions in light of Clements’ death.


“Our community is known for facing our challenges head on, and this will be no different,” Kaptain said. “Whether you are a resident in the community, a member of law enforcement or a service provider in Elgin, we all have a role to play in determining solutions for our community and moving forward, together.”
