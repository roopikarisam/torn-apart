WARNING - DISTRESSING CONTENT: Christopher Clay Rudd, 35, was up in court to appear before a judge in Utah on drugs charges when - without any warning - got up from the bench in the courtroom and made a run for it


This is the moment a heroic security guard looked up and saw a man falling from a balcony - and dashed out to try and grab him.

Christopher Clay Rudd, 35, was up in court to appear before a judge on drugs charges on Monday when - without any warning - got up from the bench in the courtroom and made a run for it.

Police in Spanish Fork, Utah, say they still don't know why he suddenly tried to get away - but local media have described it as an escape attempt.

From video footage of the incident there was no apparent extra security inside the court room to stop him legging it - suggesting that nobody had expected it to happen.

Despite him being handcuffed, CCTV shows how Rudd calmly get up from the bench and walk through the small saloon-type door partition separating the accused from the gallery.

He dashed to the main door at the back of the court room.

A female security guard who was in the court room can be seen spotting him and running after him, a split second behind.

A different camera in the corridor on the first floor outside the court room shows how Rudd then tipped headfirst over a balcony - to fall to the ground below.

Local media reports that he deliberately jumped.

A third camera picked up what happened seconds before Rudd fell - a security guard apparently checking people in at the court house entrance looking up after hearing a commotion.

The unnamed guard dashed to try and catch Rudd as he fell.

Fortunately - even though he was only a split-second too late and Rudd hit the floor - the escapee is only reported to have received minor cuts.

He is due back in court on theft and drug-related charges on May 21.
