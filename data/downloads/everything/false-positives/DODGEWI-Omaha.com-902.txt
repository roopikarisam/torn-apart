A 31-year-old Council Bluffs man sought on federal charges was arrested following a vehicle pursuit in the Bluffs.

Police said officers began following the man near Madison Avenue and Bennett Street on Wednesday afternoon. He fled in a 2002 Pontiac Bonneville at high speeds on westbound Interstate 80 from Madison Avenue, police said.

The man left I-80 at the South Expressway and turned north. The man evaded stop sticks at 23rd Avenue and South Expressway, then headed north on the South Expressway at a high speed, police said.

Later, the man braked and slid into the back of a 2017 Dodge Durango driven by Julia Santon, 50, of Council Bluffs, police said. Santon’s vehicle was pushed into the back of a 2001 Chrysler minivan driven by Carolyn Brown, 74, of the Bluffs. The wanted man’s vehicle also hit the minivan.

The man was quickly taken into custody, police said.

The man and Stanton did not report any injuries, police said. Brown was taken to a Bluffs hospital with minor injuries, police said.

In addition to the federal charges, the man was booked into the Pottawattamie County Jail on suspicion of eluding arrest, reckless driving and having no insurance, police said.
