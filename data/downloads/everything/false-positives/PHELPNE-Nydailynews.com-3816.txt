Investigators reportedly said they seized bloody bedsheets, a knife set and an empty box of cold medicine from the home of Matthew Phelps, the aspiring North Carolina pastor accused of brutally stabbing his wife.

Phelps, 29, was charged with his wife's murder after he told a 911 dispatcher in a bizarre call last month that he woke up from a nightmare to find 29-year-old Lauren Phelps dead in the bedroom of their Raleigh home.

Phelps said he thought he did it after taking too much cough medicine.

According to a search warrant obtained by The News &amp; Observer, the couple's bedsheets, bedspread and pillowcases were seized from the home. The warrant states that the items were stained "with an unknown red substance."

Investigators also found an empty box of Coricidin Cough &amp; Cold medicine, a knife block set, several laptops, a desktop computer and Lauren's iPhone.

Various other items were found in the residence including a mortgage statement and receipts.

Phelps called 911 a little after 1:10 a.m. on Sept. 1 saying that his wife was dead and he thinks he killed her.

"There's blood all over me, and there's a bloody knife on the bed. I think I did it," he said. "I took more medicine than I should have. I took Coricidin Cough and Cold because I know it can make you feel good and sometimes I can't sleep at night."

The couple had been married less than a year when she was murdered.

"I can't believe I did this," he said at another point during the six-minute call. "Oh my God. Oh God. She didn't deserve this. Why?"

Phelps was charged with murder and is being held at the Wake County Jail without bail. If convicted, he could face life in prison or the death penalty.
