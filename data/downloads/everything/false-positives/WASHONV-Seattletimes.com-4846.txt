RENO, Nev. (AP) — Reno police have arrested a suspect in the killing of a woman two years ago.

Police say 41-year-old Robert Paul Eikelberger was booked into the Washoe County Jail on Friday on an open murder charge.

Detectives say he’s a suspect in the death of Sierra Ceccarelli in December 2016. She was found dead south of Meadowood Mall on Devonshire Lane near U.S. Interstate 580.

No other details have been released.

It’s not clear if Eikelberger has an attorney or will be appointed one at a pending court appearance.
