A Hoffman Estates man was being held in Texas this week on charges of sexual assault and abuse of a child resulting from an investigation by the Lake Zurich Police Department, according to the Lake County Sheriff's Office.


Jeffrey W. Huckeby, 48, of the 1700 block of Kelberg Avenue, was taken into custody Wednesday and charged with one count of predatory criminal sexual assault of a child and three counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse in a warrant obtained by Lake Zurich police, according to a sheriff's office statement.


"The Lake County Sheriff's Office and members of the USMS-GLRFTF attempted to locate Huckeby and were unsuccessful. They learned Huckeby likely fled to Texas to avoid apprehension," the statement added. "(Through) coordination with the U.S. Marshals Service â€” Northern District Texas, Huckeby was located hiding in a trailer near the 8400 block of Country Road 6440 in Lubbock, Texas."


Huckeby was transported to the Lubbock County Detention Center, where he remained Friday pending an extradition hearing, according to the statement.
