HARLINGEN — Frances Cuellar knew her baby was ready to be born while the fireworks were still going off well after midnight. 

“After the fireworks, that’s when the contractions started,” said Cuellar, 23. “I told my husband and he said, ‘I’m going to call the ambulance.’”

“He was already coming,” she recalled yesterday morning as she looked down at her son, Keanu, asleep in her arms.

Keanu was born at 2:56 a.m., the first baby born at Valley Baptist Medical Center yesterday, becoming Harlingen’s first baby of the new year. The first baby at Harlingen Medical Center was delivered at 10:11 a.m.

“It was quick, it was smooth,” Cuellar said, rocking the sleeping infant.

When she realized she’d given birth to a boy she started crying.

“I’d always wanted a boy,” said Cuellar, who has four daughters.

“It’s a big blessing for us, and our girls are anxious to see him,” she said. Her husband Jesus was at home with the girls but they would be there soon to see the much anticipated brother and son.

She explained the name.

“The actor,” she said, referring to Keanu Reeves. “Me and my husband, we decided we were going to find a name that was different, something unique, because he’s our first boy.”

She has high hopes for her son as she does for all her children.

“I want him to accomplish whatever he sets his mind to,” she said. “I am going to support him and push him and make sure he doesn’t take the wrong path.”
