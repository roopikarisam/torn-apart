COUNCIL BLUFFS — A Pottawattamie County jury found a Council Bluffs man guilty on Thursday of two counts of sexual abuse.

Roger Lustgraaf, 58, faces up to 50 years in prison. He is being held at the Pottawattamie County Jail.

According to the police report, officers met with the victim — a minor — who said Lustgraaf had sexually assaulted her while she was asleep. She also accused Lustgraaf of abusing her while she was sitting on his lap on several occasions, the police report stated.

Lustgraaf denied the allegations, police said.

Lustgraaf’s attorneys, Joseph Reedy and Joe Narmi, declined to comment. A sentencing date has not been set.

Assistant Pottawattamie County Attorney Shelly Sudmann said the family of the victim is happy with the verdict.

“They’re happy for the opportunity to disclose what happened to her and to have someone listen and be proactive,” she said. “The police, the prosecutors and the jury believed her.”
