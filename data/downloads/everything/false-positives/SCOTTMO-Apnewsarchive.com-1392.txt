SCOTT, Ark. (AP) â€” A woman who was kidnapped and thrown from a bridge into the frigid Arkansas River swam to safety, Little Rock police said.

Police found the 42-year-old woman suffering from hypothermia on Christmas morning after receiving a 911 call from someone who heard her screaming for help. She is being treated at a hospital, KATV reported .


A police report says the woman told investigators that she was kidnapped and thrown from the Interstate 430 bridge after witnessing a shooting during a home invasion in Scott, 15 miles (24 kilometers) southeast of Little Rock. Lonoke County sheriff's officials said Arlin Nugent, 49, died at the scene after being shot. A second person was wounded in the attack and has been taken to a hospital. Authorities did not reveal the condition of the second person.

Little Rock police, Arkansas State Police and Lonoke County deputies arrested Richard Gilliam on Monday at an apartment in Little Rock after the kidnapping victim told authorities that Gilliam was one of two suspects.

Gilliam, 33, is being held at Lonoke County jail on $1 million bond. He faces charges of capital murder, attempted capital murder, aggravated residential burglary and kidnapping. Gilliam's next court appearance is scheduled for February. Online jail records don't indicate that he has an attorney who can comment on his behalf.

Authorities are still searching for the second suspect.
