Davidson County Sheriff Daron Hall said the deadly shooting at a Tennessee Waffle House shows that the U.S. has “too many guns.”


Hall made the comments during a press conference on Tuesday, two days after police say 29-year-old Travis Reinking opened fire at the restaurant, killing four people and injuring multiple others. 


“[It’s] evidence that we have too many guns and too many mentally ill people,” Hall said, according to BuzzFeed News.





Other law enforcement officials said that there is evidence Reinking has mental health issues.


Hall said that the criminal justice system “cannot solve the mental health problem."


“When mental illness and access to guns collide, we often see tragedy unfold," he added in a tweet.
