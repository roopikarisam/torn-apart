Dozier is slated to die Wednesday, July 11, 2018, by a three-drug lethal injection combination never before tried in any state and has said repeatedly he wants his sentence carried out and he doesn't care if it's painful.

HARLINGEN — Police said a Raymondville man died after he was struck by a pickup while attempting a left turn on Ed Carey Drive yesterday morning on his motorcycle. 

The 75-year-old died from his injuries at the hospital.

“When he made the turn he didn’t clear the lane and he was struck by an oncoming vehicle,” police Commander David Osborne said.

“He was hit square by a pickup truck.”

Police arrived at the crash just after 7:30 a.m. in the 200 block of North Ed Carey Drive.

According to witnesses, the motorcycle caught fire, which was put out with fire extinguishers.

Witnesses said the rider of the motorcycle was thrown off his bike and landed more than 10 feet away from the point of the crash.

Police are not releasing the identity of the motorcyclist until his family is notified of his death. He was taken to Valley Baptist Medical Center in critical condition, where he died as a result of his injuries.

Police were still investigating and mapping the crash at 11:30 a.m. before clearing the scene.

According to police, based on their investigation no criminal charges are expected to be filed.
