HARLINGEN — The Veteran Students Alliance Club at Texas State Technical College will be hosting its Fourth Annual Car, Truck and Motorcycle Show tomorrow to raise funds for veteran student scholarships.

This is the largest fundraiser for the student-run organization that assists veterans and their families with the transition to civilian life and awards scholarships, a tradition started in 2013.

“Sometimes our veteran students come in with no benefits or not enough benefits and these scholarships help supplement what they need to attend TSTC,” said Veteran Center Director Steve Guevara. “These scholarships have made the difference in many lives and have allowed veterans the chance at a new career.”

Every semester, three students receive a $300 scholarship that can be used to cover tuition, books and supplies, tools or room and board.

Student veterans who apply for the scholarship must have prior military service, 90 plus days, or 30 days medical discharge; be a part-time student; have a 2.0 grade-point average and complete a 300-word essay.

“The scholarships we award our veteran students act as a reminder that they are not forgotten and we are here to help them in any way we can,” said TSTC Veterans Program Officer Jose Villegas.

There are three competitive categories that car, truck and motorcycle enthusiasts can sign up for to help support the cause: Best in Show, Provost Choice and People’s Choice. Registration fee to enter a car is $20.

The show is free and open to the public, but to those wanting to contribute to the club’s mission can purchase tickets for $1 that will count as one vote for their favorite vehicle for the People’s Choice award.

Winners in all three categories will receive a framed United States flag plaque, gift cards and car care gift sets that have been donated by local restaurants and auto shops.

“All money raised from competitors, spectators and vendors goes a long way when you’re helping students pursue an educational dream,” said Guevara.

TSTC alumnus Frank Macias, owner of Frankie Flav’z in Harlingen, will also be joining the cause. He will have his food truck at the event with a portion of the proceeds going to the scholarship fund.

“We want to encourage our community to come out and support our students,” said Villegas. “The more people we have in attendance, the bigger our event grows annually and the more students we are able to help.”

Since the event’s initiation, the Veteran Students Alliance Club has raised more than $3,000.
