What Happened Here Before

                                — 300,000,000— First a sea: soft sands, muds, and marls

               — loading, compressing, heating, crumpling,

               crushing, recrystallizing, infiltrating,

several times lifted and submerged,

intruding molten granite magma

               deep-cooled and speckling,

                               gold quartz fills the cracks—



                               — 80,000,000—

sea-bed strata raised and folded,

               granite far below.

warm quiet centuries of rains

               (make dark red tropic soils)

               wear down two miles of surface,

lay bare the veins and tumble heavy gold

               in streambeds

                               slate and schist rock-riffles catch it –

volcanic ash floats down and dams the streams,

               piles up the gold and gravel—  

                               — 3,000,000—

flowing north, two rivers joined,

               to make a wide long lake.

and then it tilted and rivers fell apart

               all running west

               to cut the gorges of the Feather,

                               Bear, and Yuba.

Ponderosa pine, manzanita, black oak, mountain yew,

               deer, coyote, bluejay, gray squirrel,

ground squirrel, fox, blacktail hare,

               ringtail, bobcat, bear,

                               all came to live here.

The original site was designed by S. Abbas Raza in 2004 but soon completely redesigned by Mikko Hyppönen and deployed by Henrik Rydberg. It was later upgraded extensively by Dan Balis in 2006. The next major revision was designed by S. Abbas Raza, building upon the earlier look, and coded by Dumky de Wilde in 2013. And this current version 5.0 has been designed and deployed by Dumky de Wilde in collaboration with S. Abbas Raza.
