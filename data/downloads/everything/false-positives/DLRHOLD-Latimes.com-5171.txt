Hello, my name is John Cherwa, and welcome back to our horse racing newsletter and I sure wish Spinning For Home had won at Keeneland. (Read on.)

The one thing I wasn’t prepared for when launching this newsletter is the amount of email I would get. It’s great, keep it coming. It’s overwhelmingly positive but there are always a few that take the opposite view. The most popular feature, according to the response from subscribers, is checking up on the talent at TVG and how their picks are doing. Some of you want it to be a daily feature.

But because none of TVG pickers had made any money the first two weeks—and now the third—some of you have labeled me a TVG hater for reporting it. You couldn’t be more wrong.

I want the TVG folks to give you winning plays. In fact I was rooting for Spinning For Home in the fifth at Keeneland as he led mid-stretch. But, alas, he finished third. If he had won, and he was a decent price, Dave Weaver would have hit the pick four. That would have been great because, frankly, it’s boring when all they do is lose.

One reader said Matt Carothers hit the pick five with his Belmont ticket on Friday and it paid $587. No doubt it is true but there was no way for me to go back and archive that page and make sure. There’s an old expression in this business, if your mother says, “I love you,” better check it out.

Back to my point, you need to look at the TVG business model. Part of their income is from the constant fix-your-prostate ads, as well as some other products that skew old, male and breeding horses. The other part of their business is their betting platform. They make it real easy. Go to their website and you can take one of their picks and make that bet by clicking one button.

So, it’s incumbent on TVG to make smart picks and give you good advice. Would you go back to a restaurant if every time you went there you got a bad meal? I don’t think so. Same applies here.

One thing that struck me is that their bets are usually pick fives and pick fours. I thought they were pushing the pick fives because the takeout was lower and thus it was a better bet. Turns out, according to one insider, is that the motivation is really to keep people watching longer, that’s why they have so many multi-race exotics.

I know nothing about running a channel devoted to horse racing, but it seems to me they need a few more Ws. Maybe giving the audience some pick threes, even a daily double could get them in the green. Yes, I know sometime they do, but not often enough.

So with all that said, let’s see how they did on this Sunday.

Santa Anita review

Beautiful Shot took advantage of a badly tiring Mourinho to win the $70,000 Speakeasy Stakes for 2 year olds by 1 ¼ lengths. (Watch here.) Beautiful Shot came from well off the pace as the second favorite at 4-1. Keith Desormeaux was the winning trainer with his brother Kent as the jockey.

“He broke terrible in his first start and he broke a bit slow today,” Kent Desormeaux told Mike Willman of Santa Anita. “…I thought they were rolling in front so I just let them go. I cut the corner and he got covered in sand…When I presented him [turning for home], he just took off. He can run.”

Keith Desormeaux, as he often does, gave a lot of credit to his brother.

“With most racing on any level, it’s all about pace,”he said commenting on splits of 21.32, 44.55 and 57.31. “I don’t know what kind of horse, especially a 2-year-old, that can maintain a 44 [second] pace. Kent won the race by judging the pace properly and that’s why he’s in the Hall of Fame.”

Odds and ends

Jockey Mike Smith was off all his Santa Anita mounts on Sunday when he missed connections coming back from Keeneland on Saturday. ... Jockey Corey Nakatani also was off all his mounts on Sunday. At the same time the stewards suspended Nakatani for three days (Oct. 22, 26 and 27) for failure to ride his mount to the finish. It was called on Hard Arch in the fifth on Saturday. … Tiki Bar Logic won a maiden claimer on Sunday by 23 ¼ lengths, biggest margin of the meeting.
