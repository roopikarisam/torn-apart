CHICAGO, May 2, 2018 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The Centers for Disease Control estimates that 20% of people ages 55 or older experience some type of mental health concern, the most common of which include anxiety and mood disorders. The goal of the Naomi Ruth Cohen Institute for Mental Health Education (NRCI) 17th Annual Community Mental Health Conference is to shine a light on some of these issues, while also informing, teaching, and identifying resources to enhance quality of life for older adults, their families and caregivers. Titled Older Adult Mental Health: Opportunities and Challenges, the conference will take place on June 3, 2018 from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. at Roycemore School in Evanston, IL. 

Registration is now open. Housed at The Chicago School of Professional Psychology, NRCI works to overcome the stigma of mental illness through promoting educational programs and supporting organizations engaged in mental illness research.

Conference discussion groups will be moderated by experts from such organizations as North Shore Senior Center, CJE SeniorLife, and Life Changes Counseling and Care Planning, and will focus on some of the most pressing topics facing older adults, including finding needed support when one is on one's own, developmental issues in aging, managing anxiety and depression as one ages, and coping with loss. 

The opening panel includes experts:

"There have been so many advances which empower people to live vibrant, fulfilling lives as they age," said Kate Mahoney, L.C.S.W., executive director, NRCI. "Our expert panel and discussion group leaders will share research, strategies and community resources for older adults and those who love and care for them.  No one should feel that they have to navigate the aging process alone."
