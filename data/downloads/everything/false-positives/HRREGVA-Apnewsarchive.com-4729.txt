PORTSMOUTH, Va. (AP) — In a story Dec. 2 about an inmate death at the Hampton Roads Regional Jail, The Associated Press reported erroneously that Jonathan D. Ellis was the third inmate to die at the jail this year. One of the three inmates died at a hospital after being transported from the jail.

A corrected version of the story is below:

25-year-old inmate found dead in Hampton Roads jail

A 25-year-old inmate has been found dead at a jail in Portsmouth

PORTSMOUTH, Va. (AP) — A 25-year-old inmate has been found dead at a jail in Portsmouth.


Officials with the Hampton Roads Regional Jail said Jonathan D. Ellis was found unresponsive late Friday afternoon and lifesaving attempts were unsuccessful.

The Virginian-Pilot reports Ellis' cause of death was not immediately available.

Linda Bryant, the jail's assistant superintendent, says he was being held on extortion and other charges.

According to the newspaper, a second inmate died at the jail earlier this year and a third, Michael Masean Hall, died at a hospital after being transported from the jail.

The facility has faced scrutiny over other inmate deaths, including that of Jamycheal Mitchell.

Mitchell, who had bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, died in August 2015 of heart failure accompanied by severe weight loss. He had been ordered to a state mental hospital but was never sent there.
