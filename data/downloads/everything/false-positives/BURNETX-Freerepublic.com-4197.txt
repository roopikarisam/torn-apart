Captain Chris Jett of the Burnet County Sheriff's Office said the officer was on his way home in the 12000 block of FM 1431 near Smithwick just after 10:00 p.m. when he saw the suspect shooting into a car with family of three. 


The officer called 911 and exchanged gunfire with the suspect. The suspect was shot in the chest and ran off into the woods, where he was found.

Suspect rammed the SUV off the road and shot into the vehicle. The family of three are ok. Off duty officer shot the suspect twice. Suspect will survive.


A very good reason to switch the driver’s side to the right.

The lefthanded now have a distinct advantage for shooting while driving.

Suspect should be double tapped at the scene. Damn city slickers.

If this were California I would say the guy was shooting at the family of 3 because THEY DIDN’T USE THE GODFREY DANIELS TURN SIGNAL AND THEY DESERVED IT!

trust me. I’m 2 car rides home from becoming the next Zodiac killer.

I’ll run right out and buy a postal jeep then.

Or, motivation to train with both hands......

Weak hand shooting....*$&amp;% yeah!

Could have been one of the California imports that have overrun the Austin area lately.

Why do you think the Zodiac killed the cabbie?.....have you ever seen how cabbies drive?

Yup, it’s frustrating, but tell me, how many times have you signalled a lane change(they called it begging way back when I took drivers ed) and have the person that was reasonably back race up to block you? People do it all the time, they especially did it to my buddy and I when we were in the company’s box truck.

That is a very dangerous stretch of highway. Only two lanes with lots of steep hills and blind curves. Drivers will try to take the turns going 70 MPH and then have to slam on their brakes when they round a turn and see the car in front of them going 30. I suspect something like that is what triggered the shooter’s road rage.

I am just a few miles away and have to drive down that highway often. You also have lots of idiots trying to pass another car right before a blind curve and either running them off the road or hitting another car head on.

It is dangerous. Hate that road. There’s always accidents. Safer to take 183 or 71 even if it takes longer.

Ill run right out and buy a postal jeep then.

NICE!
Very good.

May want to add a turbo or nitrous or both?
I think they are a bit slow?

That said, I recall the old line’You might outrun my old Chevrolet, but you won’t outrun my old two way’.

Yes. . .and the DC area is especially bad about this.

A second or so when I start my lane change, I turn on the turn signal. Don’t turn it on too early because people WILL race up to cut you off.

With a turn signal on, if a collision happens, anything from just a ‘tap’ to a full blown wreck, I can legitimately say I had my turn signal on and the idiot ran into me (and the turn signal light would back me up because if it was on then the filament would be burnt-out thereby proving my innocence and the other guys recklessness.

“trust me. Im 2 car rides home from becoming the next Zodiac killer.”

I feel’ya, man, I truly do.

They came with a four cylinder. but a seventies chevy straight six will bolt right up. They were 2 wheel drive only, so they would be only a curiosity.

 Postal, you say...


Weak hand shooting....*$&amp;% yeah!

And from a moving vehicle!
WOW.

That must be an interesting day at the range?

Does anyone practice that?

We have a law in Washington State that says you are not suppose to have your cell phone pressed up against your ear while you are driving. The other day we were in heavy gridlock traffic and the guy ahead of us was gabbing away and he kept not noticing when the lights turned green causing us to sit behind a couple of intersections for an extra few minutes.

I honked at him the second time the light turned green and everyone in front of him had already gone through the intersection. He of course did not move his car to punish us and everyone behind us for disrupting his call and gave us the finger instead. So I yelled at him to get off the phone. Two other people nearby also on their phones thought that I was yelling at them and yelled back for me in foul language to mind my own business.

Why is it that so many people are unable to both talk on their phones and keep an eye on traffic that they have to make laws about it? And this just demonstrates how ineffective laws can be when so many scofflaws ignore them anyway.

BINGO!!!

And one hand reload and cocking.

Stay Safe
