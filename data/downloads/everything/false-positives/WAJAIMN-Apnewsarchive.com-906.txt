EVERETT, Wash. (AP) â€” A Snohomish County judge has been sentenced to a day in jail for driving drunk in August in an incident in which her car spun out, struck a concrete barrier and came to rest facing oncoming traffic along Interstate 405.

The Daily Herald reports 48-year-old Marybeth Dingledy of Mill Creek apologized Wednesday in King County District Court.

She said the incident will continue to have an impact on her.


She also was fined $5,000, with $4,650 suspended and ordered to be on probation for 36 months.

Dingledy previously pleaded to driving under the influence.

Police reports indicate Dingledy's blood-alcohol level reportedly tested at 0.122 and 0.115 at the time of arrest. It is illegal to drive in Washington with a blood-alcohol level of 0.08 or greater.

No one was injured in the crash.

Dingledy has served as a Snohomish County Superior Court judge since 2012.
