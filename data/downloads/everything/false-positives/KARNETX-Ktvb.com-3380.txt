BOISE - The Idaho Department of Correction is investigating what it called a disruption by Idaho inmates housed at a contract-bed facility in Texas.


According to officials, inmates damaged two televisions, ripped apart a mattress and broke several sprinkler heads at the Karnes County Correctional Center in Karnes City.

The incident reportedly happened late Tuesday night, just before midnight.


After talking with the prison's warden, the inmates returned to their bunks, IDOC said in a Facebook post on Wednesday.


No injuries were reported, and the damage was less than $1,000.


Idaho began moving inmates to the Karnes facility in February due to a shortage of beds in Idaho. A group of 150 inmates arrived on Feb. 13, and a second group of 100 arrived on March 14.

The inmates are being held at the facility temporarily while the department seeks a long-term agreement with a prison-bed provider.


IDOC officials did not say what may have prompted the disruption.
