DETROIT (AP) — A tentative deal is advancing businessman Dan Gilbert’s plans for a downtown Detroit soccer stadium and a new $520 million criminal justice complex.

Wayne County Executive Warren Evans on Thursday announced the agreement. Wayne County would acquire some Detroit Department of Transportation property and the city would acquire the county Land Bank-owned former American Motors headquarters on Detroit’s west side.

The deal is subject to city and county approval. It would give Wayne County enough land for the criminal justice center if a deal can be reached with Gilbert’s Rock Ventures. Gilbert, who owns the Cleveland Cavaliers, wants to use the site of a suspended jail project for the stadium.

Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan says the deal will allow the city to speed up potential redevelopment of the American Motors site.
