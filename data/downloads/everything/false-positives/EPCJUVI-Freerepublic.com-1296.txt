And more reminiscent of The Wizard of Oz than the three Rs or even John Dewey. "In addition to the 937 students to whom D.C. officials improperly granted diplomas in 2017, a recent audit undertaken in neighboring Prince Georges County, Maryland, found that as many as a quarter of that districts 2016 and 2017 high school graduates may not have met requirements," Brandon L. Wright writes in an article distributed by the Thomas Fordham Institute. "A year earlier, five veteran educators in El Paso were indicted on federal charges in connection to, as an FBI agent said, 'criminal conduct and brazen efforts to manipulate testing populations, graduation rates, and attendance figures'; three have since pleaded guilty to related charges and agreed to cooperate in the trials of the other two."

How do kids like Nicholas Cruz “slip through” in spite of dozens of people noting dysfunctional and violent behavior?

Well, the same attitude among disinterested, disconnected education bureaucrats that contributes to that problem is evidenced here.

The same thing is going on here. The main result is that the kids who try to go to college are having to take remediation classes at ever higher rates.

 Gosh, look at you directing traffic toward your blog.


 What a surprising thing.


 Almost as if you are trolling for traffic.


I bet that is a big reason why employees will only hire people with a Bachelor’s Degree. Of course, those are being watered down and some employees realized that and now demand a Master’s Degree. We will see where this ends up. I will NOT get a Doctorate that is for sure. A Master’s Degree was more then enough education to last a life time. If they start requiring a Doctorate, I will be up a creek I suppose.

They are running an extended daycare system. Juvenile delinquents RULE the schools and they should be outraged at their schools discipline code and screaming about that. Nikolas Cruz was never busted at school because of the new 2013 NAACP collaborative discipline policy:

Broward Countys School Discipline Agreement signed by the Sheriff, State Atty and local judges.

These various behaviors will NOT result in suspension or expulsion or notification to the police. Instead they receive warnings, lectures and possible stern scolding!

These infractions include:
All student misbehavior and
these non-violent infractions:

Disrupting or Interfering with class
Affray - fighting in a public place
Theft if less than $300
Vandalism damages &lt; $1,000
Disorderly conduct
Trespassing, Loitering or Prowling
Criminal Mischief
Gambling
Harrassment or Threats
Alcohol -all related offenses
Possession of Cannabis
Drug Paraphernalia
Obstructing Justice w/out Violence

Go ahead kids. Smoke pot, booze it up, fight, THREATEN a teacher and tear the bloody place up! The NAACP &amp; Broward sheriff &amp; schools got your back. Since your family has failed to discipline, a sanctuary program for criminal youth continues at your school.

Uh, why is the FBI involved? Probably because public schools take federal money? Sheesh.

The our local school districts students who withdraw to homeschool are taken out of the graduation count. So I figure over the course of 10 years, I saved the district at least 20 know de who would not have graduated had they stayed in public school. I only had 3 kids who were dismissed by me and never went back to either finish or get GEDs. They were all boys (but not all my boys were dismissed) who would simply not respect me or my rules-3 chances and they were out.

But...the district didn’t have to count them as non-graduates...looks better that way, doncha know.

Lets see school taxes are collected and sent to the central government at the state capital.

Then the central government pays out some of those funds to the school districts based on number of students and promotion rates provided by the districts.

So why would the districts cook their books?
