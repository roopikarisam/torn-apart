The first significant storm system of the year this week will cause a concern for debris flow in recent burn areas across Southern California, according to the National Weather Service, prompting officials to issue mandatory evacuations in parts of Los Angeles, Ventura and Santa Barbara counties.

The storm is expected to bring unseasonably warm conditions, up to 4 inches of rain, snow, gusty winds and possible thunderstorms between Monday and Tuesday.

Light rain started to move south from Point Conception about 4 a.m. Monday and fell steadily throughout the day, brining an inch or more to parts of L.A., Ventura and San Luis Obispo counties by nightfall, according to the weather service.

Downtown L.A., Bel-Air, Ventura, Ojai and Palmdale all received between 1/4 to 1/2 of an inch of rain by 10 p.m. Monday.

Heavier rains are expected to drench the region late Monday evening into the overnight hours as the main storm front moves into the area, brining damaging winds gusts and possible thunderstorms, forecasters warned. The heaviest rain and strongest winds are expected between 2 a.m. and 8 a.m.

Some areas could be inundated with a third of an inch of rain per hour.

The anticipated severity of the first storm of the season has the weather service and U.S. Geological Survey warning of dangerous land and water flow, caused by heavy rainfall on loose soil.

Debris flow is likely Monday night into Tuesday in the areas burned during the Thomas Fire in Ventura and Santa Barbara counties, the Creek Fire in the Sylmar area and the La Tuna Fire in the Verdugo Mountains.

Amid concerns about the potential for mudslides and flooding, Ventura County officials announced mandatory evacuations in parts of the county burned by the Thomas Fire — including Matilija Canyon to North Fork and Wheeler Gorge in Ojai.

Santa Barbara County officials announced mandatory evacuations for areas also burned in the Thomas Fire, such as El Capitan Canyon and Las Flores Canyon, offering a full view of those and other evacuated areas in an interactive map.

Evacuations have been issued for areas below the Thomas, Whittier, Sherpa and Rey Fire Burn Areas beginning at NOON TMRW Monday, January 8 due to an approaching winter storm. Full info &amp; link to interactive map at: https://t.co/aMpP8tihRa.  You can also call 211. pic.twitter.com/JvvkIh7gJD

Mandatory evacuations were also ordered for about 300 people living in areas of Los Angeles County burned by the Creek Fire, including Kagel Canyon, Lopez Canyon, and Little Tujunga Canyon, the L.A. County Sheriff's Department said.

In Duarte, areas where the Fish Fire burned were also cleared. About 180 homes in those areas were evacuated beginning Monday evening, as 2 to 5 inches of rain were expected later in the night and following morning, officials said.

Residents in the Ventura area were also preparing over the weekend by filling sandbags.

"We have a significant amount of sandbags on the hillside to try and divert the [rain] flow into the existing storm drain system," said Ventura resident Ewelina Mutkaowska of the burned area where her home sits.

The Ventura Sheriff's Department was offering free sandbags at local fire stations, while county officials released information about preparing for storm conditions, posting a map from the U.S. Geological Survey showing hazardous debris flow areas and information on topics such as buying flood insurance.

At dozens of dam sites in the county, bulldozers were dredging up soil to prepare for the coming rainstorm amid concerns about flooding and possible mudslides.

"The hills out here sort of facing the ocean at the edge of the cities are looking at maybe three inches of rain tonight," said Jeff Pratt, director of Ventura County Public Works, as he looked over an area of Santa Paula.

"And that could start [getting] stuff moving," he said of the rain coming down on the soil, adding that county officials are trying to remove mass amounts of sediment to prepare.

"We’re trying to move 10,000 cubic yards of soil out of here," Pratt said.

In Ventura, one local resident said his neighborhood has struggled with concerns about mudslides even in less severe conditions.

"We’re worried about the debris washing down the street from all the fires above us," he said. "Even in a normal rainstorm, this is a problem area."

His home was damaged in the Thomas Fire, so he's taking extra steps to prepare for the coming storm that could wreak more havoc. He parked his truck in front of a barrier of sandbags built around his home — a measure he said will give "a little added protection."

There's also been concerns about possible flooding and mudslides in the areas left charred by Canyon Fire 2 in Orange County, the O.C. Register reported.

How communities in the burn areas will fare during the rainstorm will depend on how much and how fast rain will fall, the Los Angeles Times reported. 

Three to 6 inches of rain are expected in the foothills and mountains of the SoCal region. Isolated totals could reach seven inches.

“Stay alert to the forecast and follow instructions from your local emergency officials,” the weather service advised.

Flooding on local streets, downed trees and power lines are also a possibility during the winter storm, officials said.

Snow levels are expected to remain above 5500 to 6000 feet during the storm. Officials are not expecting wintry driving conditions along the Grapevine, but strong winds are in the forecast into early Tuesday morning, according to the weather service.

Warmer and drier conditions are expected heading into the weekend, the weather service reported.
