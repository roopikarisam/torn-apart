A fourth suspect has been arrested in the brutal attack of Deandre Harris, who was seriously injured while protesting the deadly white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Va., in August.


Tyler Watkins Davis, 49, is facing charges of malicious wounding in the incident last year. Officers with the Clay County, Fla., Sheriff’s Department arrested Davis in Middleburg, Fla., and he is currently being held in the county jail pending extradition to Charlottesville, according to a press release from the Charlottesville Police Department, WVIR NBC 29 notes.


No further details were given on Davis’ case, with officers citing the pending investigation. 


Harris, 20, was viciously attacked by white supremacists at the rally. The attack went viral after journalist Zach D. Roberts captured photos of Harris being beaten with poles by the group of thugs. Another journalist, Chuck Modi, also posted video of the incident, which occurred in a parking garage near the University of Virginia campus.
