Friends and fellow students held a vigil Sunday evening at Moon Valley High School to honor their classmate, Carlos Sanchez, who died two days after collapsing on the football field Friday. 


Sanchez, a junior and a starting linebacker who also played running back, collapsed during a game Friday night against Glendale's Cactus High School and was rushed to John C. Lincoln North Mountain Hospital in critical condition.


Sanchez, 16, was blocking, landed on the ground and hit his head, according to Gary Welchel, the state commissioner for officials with the Arizona Interscholastic Athletic Association.


"This was a football play," Welchel said in a statement Monday morning.


Moon Valley football coach Seth Millican said he is not able to talk about what happened on the field at the request of the Sanchez family. 


The Glendale Union High School District issued a statement about his death Sunday evening: "Our school community is saddened by the news of Carlos’s passing. We extend our deepest condolences to Carlos’s family and friends during this difficult time."


Moon Valley Principal Anat Salyer also sent a letter with the news to parents on Sunday.


Some of those friends stood and cried and expressed their shock at Sunday's vigil.


Sandra Carter, a family friend who has known Sanchez since kindergarten, described him as “a smart kid with a bright future.”


Isaac Villalobos, a friend of Sanchez, said he broke down in tears when he first heard what happened on Friday. He described Sanchez as "a really cool guy. "


The school will have a team of social workers on campus Monday to support students and staff, according to the school district.

Moon Valley football coach Seth Millican said Monday that he hopes Carlos' family can find some peace knowing that Carlos is "the symbol of all that is pure, all that is good and all that is selfless in the human spirit."


Millican also said it had been his privilege to coach Carlos for the last two seasons. 


"Carlos Sanchez had a 200 pound heart stuffed into a 170 pound body. Carlos Sanchez was the very best of us," Millican said, "He was the best we had to offer. He was a constant force of hard work and selflessness on our team. Carlos Sanchez, not because of his death, but because of how he lived, has made each and every person on our team a better person."


Millican is not sure yet if his team will practice on Monday.


Rest In Peace carlos😢 you put everyone before you and you are the most caring person I knew. I know for sure you’re going to a better place. God is taking care of you now❤️

“I was on the field and I turned around and (saw) him standing and then the next thing you know he was laying on the ground not moving at all,” teammate Bobby Carlon said in a direct message. “They then carried him off the field and took him to the hospital.”


Cactus coach Larry Fetkenhier said that his team is keeping Moon Valley in their thoughts and prayers.


"The Cactus Football Family prays for Carlos Sanchez, his family and all the Moon Valley Football Family," Fetkenhier said in a statement.


Moon Valley's booster group tweeted that it will be taking donations at next Friday's game to help with Sanchez's medical costs.


Friends, teammates and school communities took to social media over the weekend to express their condolences.


Rest In Paradise Carlos you are a true warrior and gave 100% effort every play you were a true friend and you will be missed ☝️ pic.twitter.com/SFw5dmXfyF
