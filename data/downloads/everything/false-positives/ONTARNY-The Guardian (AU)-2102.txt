The brother of New York Giants cornerback Janoris Jenkins has been charged with aggravated manslaughter in the death of a 25-year-man whose body was found in the NFL player’s New Jersey home.

The Bergen County prosecutor’s office says 34-year-old William H Jenkins of Fair Lawn was arrested Tuesday and charged Wednesday in the death of Roosevelt Rene, a Jenkins family friend whose body was discovered Tuesday. 

Acting prosecutor Dennis Calo said Wednesday that William Jenkins is in custody in the Ontario County jail in New York state, adding that the investigation is ongoing and the defendant is presumed innocent.

The home of Janoris Jenkins, who has been in Florida since the end of the Giants’ voluntary minicamp two weeks ago according to ESPN sources, is located about out 10 miles north of MetLife Stadium. Property records show Janoris Jenkins has lived at the house the last two years. 

The Giants told ESPN on Tuesday that they “are aware of and monitoring the situation”.
