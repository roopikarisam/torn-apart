BREAUX BRIDGE, La. (AP) — A Louisiana police officer is accused of having sex with a 16-year-old.

Louisiana State Police arrested 29-year-old Craig David (DAH-veed) of the Breaux Bridge Police Department on charges of carnal knowledge of a juvenile , computer-aided solicitation of a minor and malfeasance in office.

Louisiana law defines carnal knowledge as consensual sex with a teen under age 17 and at least four years younger than the accused.

David is at the St. Martin Parish Detention Center, with bond set at $40,000. A sheriff’s office spokeswoman did not know if he has an attorney.

Breaux Bridge Police Chief Rollie Cantu says David is a three-year officer.

Cantu asked state police to investigate after getting a complaint this month. State police say in a news release that the alleged misconduct began in December.
