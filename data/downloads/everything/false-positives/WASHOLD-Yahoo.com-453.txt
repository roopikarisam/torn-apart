Washington State police want felony charges filed against USC’s Liam Jimmons.


Jimmons allegedly shoved a Washington State student to the turf following USC’s loss to the Cougars on Sept. 30. Washington State students rushed the field after the game, and Jimmons allegedly knocked him to the ground while running off the field.

According to KXLY in Washington, the case has been turned over to the county prosecutor’s office for an official determination on charges from the alleged incident.


The WSU student that got hit has been to the hospital twice for a concussion suffered from the alleged assault. Because of the seriousness of the injury, WSU police want Jimmons to be charged with felony second-degree assault. The case has been turned over to the Whitman County Prosecutor’s Office for a charging decision. Jimmons has appeared in five games for USC this season.

USC coach Clay Helton said the week after the game that the team’s punishment for Jimmons would remain in-house. Washington State was fined $25,000 by the Pac-12 for the field storming because USC hadn’t vacated the field before fans ran out of the stands.


Washington State plays Stanford on Saturday while USC hosts Arizona.
