U.S. Rep. Scott Taylor, who is vying for reelection in Virginia, had some choice words for Republican senate candidate Corey Stewart this week, but refused to condemned Stewart for the racism, bigotry and anti-Semitism that he is associated with.


While speaking at a campaign rally in Virginia Beach over the weekend, Democratic congressional candidate Elaine Luria argued that Virginians “are better than this,” according to the The Virignia-Pilot. 


“We are better than ripping infants from their mother’s breast at the border and placing them in a detention center. We are better than the bigotry, and the racism and the anti-Semitism that we saw on the streets of Charlottesville last year,” she explained.


Luria said that Taylor should “reject the fact that Corey Stewart stands next to racists and anti-Semites.”


When the paper caught up with Taylor, he appeared to be enraged by Luria’s remarks.


“I don’t give a s— about Corey Stewart,” Taylor ranted. “No one else does either except for Democrats who are trying to target me. … No one cares, except for a small teeny amount of people you met at the cupcake place.”


“What are they trying to say? That Scott Taylor likes Corey Stewart so therefore he’s a racist?” he continued. “Do you think that’s going to play here? My son is named after a black guy. I’m a military guy. We don’t give a s— about where you come from. Black, white, brown, gay, straight. I don’t care.”


Taylor, who has a 5-year-old son named Sterling, did not say which black man he was named after.
