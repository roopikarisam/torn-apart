CHICAGO, May 15, 2018 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The Pulmonary Fibrosis Foundation (PFF) has expanded its nationwide Care Center Network with the selection of 15 additional sites, including two in Wisconsin and Iowa which previously did not have care center locations. The PFF's Care Center Network (CCN), a collection of medical centers with expertise in accurately diagnosing and treating individuals with pulmonary fibrosis (PF), now has 60 sites in 30 states. The 15 new sites will help fill a treatment gap, increasing access to quality care and services that are critical to the local PF community.

Newly designated medical centers include Banner University Medical Center in Phoenix; Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas; Cleveland Clinic in Cleveland; Cleveland Clinic Florida in Weston, Fla; Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit; Houston Methodist Hospital in Houston; LeBauer Health Care at Cone Health in Greensboro, N.C.; Loyola University Medical Center in Maywood, Ill.; Spectrum Health System in Grand Rapids, Mich.; St. Luke's Hospital in Chesterfield, Mo.; UC Davis Interstitial Lung Disease Program in Sacramento, Calif.; University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus in Aurora, Co.; University of Florida in Gainesville, Fla.; University of Iowa in Iowa City, Iowa; and University of Wisconsin in Madison, Wis. (A complete list of CCN sites appears at the end of the release.)


"As the leading resource for the pulmonary fibrosis community, the Pulmonary Fibrosis Foundation is committed to developing new tools and support to help ensure patients receive a swift and accurate diagnosis along with the highest quality of care," said Dr. Gregory P. Cosgrove, Chief Medical Officer for the PFF. "The launch of our 15 new Care Center Network sites provides crucial resources for care along with an infrastructure that facilitates research toward a cure." 


The PFF Care Center Network advances care by fostering a multidisciplinary approach to deliver comprehensive patient care. Experts in pulmonary medicine, rheumatology, radiology, and pathology are part of the care team at each medical center. In addition, many Care Center Network sites offer a PF support group and partner with the PFF on patient education programs and research initiatives.


More than 200,000 Americans are living with pulmonary fibrosis, a deadly and complex disease which causes progressive scarring in the lungs. Pulmonary fibrosis causes more than forty-thousand deaths in the U.S. annually. Fifty-thousand new cases are diagnosed each year. There is no known cure.
