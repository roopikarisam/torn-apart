PITTSBURGH (KDKA) — Police say a man has confessed to burglarizing one Catholic school, and they believe he may be a suspect in the burglary of several others.

Jeffrey Chambers, 35, is in the Allegheny County Jail charged with what police say was a burglary at Seton-La Salle High School after they stopped him in Stowe Township for something else. 

Police in Mount Lebanon released surveillance video of a man walking outside Seton-La Salle High School the same night it was burglarized.

“Someone had forced entry into a window in the rear of the building,” said Lt. Duane Fisher, of the Mt. Lebanon Police Department. “And then spent probably about an hour inside the building at the time of the burglary. It was approximately $2,800 in cash, a couple gift cards, and I believe one other small item.”

“He was stopped by Stowe Township police,” Fisher said. “They conducted an inventory of his vehicle. In the vehicle inventory they found several items that matched what he was wearing that night of the burglary.” 

The break-ins happened around the same time as several other incidents at Catholic schools, including St. Raphael Elementary School in Morningside and St. Aquinas Academy. All of them were burglarized as well. 

“I believe he may be a suspect in other cases. I’m not sure at what point other departments are in their investigations,” said Fisher.

While those investigations are ongoing, police are more than confident they have the right man in at least one case.

“He did own up, or confess, to the burglary at Seton,” Fisher told KDKA. 

Police say Chambers told them he was homeless and his motivation for the break-ins was drugs.
