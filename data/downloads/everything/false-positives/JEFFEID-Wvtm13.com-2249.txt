A report about two young girls who had been sexually abused led to the arrest of a Pinson man. The Jefferson County Sheriff's Office says 34-year-old Thomas Whitlock is charged for sexual abuse that happened over a two year period.


The sheriff's office says it received the initial report Monday, June 25. The next day, deputies executed a search warrant at Whitlock's home, and he was taken in for questioning.


That's when authorities say Whitlock admitted to abusing the two young girls.


He is now charged with sexual abuse of a child less than 12 years old, first degree sexual abuse, and first degree sodomy. He's in the Jefferson County Jail on a $150,000 bond.
