FORT COLLINS, C0 -- A Fort Collins man was arrested after being founding possession of more than 700,000 child porn images and videos, Fort Collins police said. 

Thomas Christopher Mares, 53, was arrested on Mar. 15, following a months-long investigation conducted by Fort Collins Police Services, the department said in a statement. 

In July 2017, Fort Collins police got word from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC) that an Internet Service Provider was reporting a local cache of sexually explicit images of children on the ISP's network, Fort Collins police said in a statement.

Officers with a warrant confiscated Mares's digital devices and a computer forensic investigator found approximately 676,000 pictures and 18,000 video files depicting sexual exploitation of children on the devices. Detectives estimate that Mares had been collecting pornographic images of children for 10-15 years. 

Mares was arrested and booked into the Larimer County Jail on 60 counts of possession of child pornography.

"FCPS encourages anyone with additional information regarding this suspect to contact Detective Jason Curtis at 970-416-2776 or Crime Stoppers of Larimer County at 970-221-6868 or www.stopcriminals.org. People may remain anonymous," police said in a statement.
