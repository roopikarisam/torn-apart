STAMFORD — A Norwalk man who admitted to making off with more than $13,000 in a bank robbery will be sentenced to six years in jail.

Isaiah Gary, 36, of Commerce Street, pleaded guilty to a second-degree robbery for the 2014 incident at First County Bank on Westport Avenue in Norwalk.

Gary, who will be sentenced in July, will also serve four years of special parole once he’s released from jail.

According to his arrest affidavit, Gary slid a note to the teller, saying “don’t be stupid.” He opened a bag and told the teller: “You don’t want to get hurt, give me the money,” the affidavit said.

The teller stuffed the bag with $13,106, but did not include any bait money or strapped cash. But Gary wanted more money, police said. He told the teller, “Grab the rest. I see it.”

The teller then slipped bait money into the bag, police said. Banks record the serial numbers on bait bills to make it easier to track proceeds from a robber.

Gary then asked for a lollipop and was given two.

After police circulated photos of the suspect, they received a tip later that day from a resident of a Strawberry Hill Avenue apartment building. The resident reported seeing a man resembling the photo in the laundry room shortly after the robbery occurred. Police said they found clothing belonging to the suspect in the laundry room.

Investigators also learned Gary had been in TD Bank prior to the First County Bank robbery. He scribbled something on a deposit slip but then left the bank when another customer entered, according to police.

Gary was previously arrested for his involvement in a bank robbery that occurred on July 23, 2007 — exactly seven years prior to his capture for the First County Bank robbery. He served two and a half years for that robbery.
