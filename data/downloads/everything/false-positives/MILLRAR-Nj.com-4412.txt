A broken tail light led to drug charges for a man and woman from Pennsylania, Secaucus police said.

Secaucus police pulled over Vincent Tene, 27, and Samantha Tene, 29, of Pittsburgh, on Route 3 West at 1:17 p.m. on Sept. 13 and found them in possession of hypodermic needles and other drug paraphernalia, Secaucus police Capt. Dennis Miller said.

Samantha Tene was also charged with hindering her own apprehension because she gave false information regarding identity, Miller said. She was also charged as a fugitive from justice from Broward County, Florida, and she was taken to Hudson County jail in Kearny.



Vincent Tene was issued a summons and released.
