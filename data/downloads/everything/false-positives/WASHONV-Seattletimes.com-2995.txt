RENO, Nev. (AP) — A 29-year-old Reno man has been arrested after sheriff’s deputies say he led multiple police agencies on a high-speed chase for more than 100 miles (160 kilometers).

Brian Stevens was being held in the Washoe County Jail without bail Thursday on multiple charges including assault with a deadly weapon, reckless driving and endangering others while disobeying a peace officer.

Sheriff’s spokesman Bob Harmon says the chase reached speeds of 110 mph (177 kph) and Stevens tried to run a deputy off the road before he was apprehended Tuesday night near Gerlach.

Harmon says the incident began when the Nevada Highway Patrol received a call from a motorist who was being chased by an unknown driver for unknown reasons near Sutcliffe before fleeing toward the Sparks area.

It’s not clear if Stevens has a lawyer or will be appointed one.
