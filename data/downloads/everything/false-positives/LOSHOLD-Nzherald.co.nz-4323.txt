 LOS ANGELES (AP) â€” The Latest on the arrests of a California woman and her boyfriend on murder and torture charges in the death of her 10-year-old son (all times local):

 5:30 p.m.

 Sheriff's investigators say a 10-year-old boy who had complained of abuse died after suffering a traumatic brain injury that led to organ failure.

 Los Angeles County sheriff's Lt. Derrick Alfred said Friday that the injury that caused the death of Anthony Avalos came from "specific actions" committed by his mother or her boyfriend.

 He wouldn't provide additional details, citing an ongoing investigation.

 Heather Maxine Barron and Kareem Ernesto Leiva were each charged Friday with one count of murder and torture.

 Anthony died last week after being found unresponsive June 20 at home in Lancaster in the Antelope Valley north of Los Angeles.

 His aunt, Maria Barron, said the boy "will always be in our hearts."

 It was unclear whether Barron or Leiva had attorney to comment on the allegations.
