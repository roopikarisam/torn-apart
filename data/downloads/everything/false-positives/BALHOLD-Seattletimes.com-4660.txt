BALTIMORE (AP) — A candidate in Maryland’s governor’s race has proposed a new state agency that would focus on stopping sexual harassment and violence.

 The Washington Post reported that Democrat Krishanti Vignarajah outlined her proposal on Monday.

She said the agency would identify repeat offenders and audit state offices. Individuals seeking office, employment or public funding would have to disclose whether they’ve committed such misconduct.

Vignarajah is one of two women in a crowded field of Democrats seeking to challenge Republican Gov. Larry Hogan next year.

She previously worked as a policy aide for former first lady Michelle Obama, at a consulting firm and Georgetown University.

Vignarajah did not provide a cost estimate. But she said the office would largely use existing resources and charge fees to companies that want certification or audits.
