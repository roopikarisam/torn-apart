Former NFL star Kellen Winslow Jr. is facing multiple serious criminal charges â€” including two counts of kidnapping with intent to commit rape, and two counts of forcible rape â€” after being arrested in San Diego County, California earlier today.

This is the second time in less than a week that Winslow Jr. has been arrested; days ago, he was detained by police after being accused of breaking into a home in a mobile home park near San Diego.

He was eventually arrested and charged with felony burglary in that case, and later released. But that's nothing compared to the severe, scary allegations being levied against Winslow now.

Hours ago, San Diego County authorities issued an arrest warrant for Winslow covering at LEAST nine new and extremely serious charges, which are as follows (below): 


- Kidnapping with intent to commit rape (2 counts)
- Forcible rape (2 counts)
- Forcible sodomy (1 count)
- Forcible oral copulation (1 count)
- Residential burglary (2 counts)
- Indecent exposure (1 count)

Goodness graciousâ€¦

Having just been arrested on these charges today, it's obviously still very early in the processâ€¦ but if Winslow is found guilty of all those charges as he's been accused, he is facing a life sentence in prison.

A search warrant has been reportedly executed on his home as police would appear to be searching for more evidence related to the alleged crimes; Winslow himself was booked into a county jail in San Diego a few hours ago, and he's being held there now.

For those unfamiliar with American football, the now-34-year-old Winslow was a longtime star in the NFL; he played in the league for a decade (2004 to 2013), which is no small feat in and of itself, and made the 2007 Pro Bowl as a tight end representing the Cleveland Browns.

His father, Kellen Winslow Sr., was also a longtime member of the NFL in his time; the elder Winslow is considered one of the greatest tight ends in league history, and is a member of both the College Football Hall of Fame and the Pro Football Hall of Fame â€” so, suffice to say, Junior here comes from a very high-profile football family.

As for this case, arraignment â€” and a formal announcement of these charges â€” is expected tomorrow. We'll keep you updated as we hear more.

So scaryâ€¦

Five years after the alleged incident, and one year after losing his trial, how is this guy STILL talking?!?!

David Mueller -- the former Denver radio DJ who was found guilty of assault and battery a year ago for grabbing Taylor Swift's bare butt during a photo op before one of her concerts -- is back in the public eye commenting about Swift, and the incident itself.

In an interview with Radar Online, Mueller doesn't hold back from voicing his displeasure about what he says Swift did to him (never the other way around, is it?), and he opens with a hell of an accusation himself (below):
