A Milwaukee man admitted to police that he approached several young boys for sexual contact on the city's southwest side and in West Allis, according to a criminal complaint.


 


Scott Allen Lucas, 59, is charged with three felony counts of child enticement sexual contact or intercourse for three incidents that took place within about an hour Sept. 13, according to the complaint filed in Milwaukee County Circuit Court.


According to the complaint, Lucas drove up to a 12-year-old boy near S. 60th St. and W. Oklahoma Ave., an 11-year-old boy near S. 49th and W. Manitoba streets and another 12-year-old boy near S. 87th St. and W. Greenfield Ave.


In each instance he offered the boys $20 for sexual contact before driving off after being rejected.


Lucas told police he approached four boys that day in Milwaukee and at Manitoba Park in West Allis, according to the complaint.


He was in the Milwaukee County Jail Monday, with cash bail set at $10,000, according to jail records.


If convicted, he could be sentenced to up to 25 years in prison on each charge, according to the complaint.
