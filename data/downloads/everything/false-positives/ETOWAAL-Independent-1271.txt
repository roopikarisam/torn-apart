Todd Entrekin has more than $1.7 million worth of property despite being on a five-figure salary

A County Sheriff who received $750,000 (£538,000) from the government to feed prisoners has bought a $740,000 (£531,000) beach house. 

Todd Entrekin, from Etowah, Alabama, has more than $1.7 million (£1.22m) worth of property despite being on a five-figure salary. 

Ethics disclosure forms show that Mr Entrekin received more than $750,000 (£538,000) from a source he identified as "Food Provisions".

The money was allocated to feed inmates in the Etowah County jail but a state law passed before World War II says that the “excess” can be kept by sheriffs. 

"In regards to feeding of inmates, we utilise a registered dietician to ensure adequate meals are provided daily," Mr Entrekin told Alabama Local News in response to the allegations. 

“As you should be aware, Alabama law is clear as to my personal financial responsibilities in the feeding of inmates. Regardless of one's opinion of this statute, until the legislature acts otherwise, the Sheriff must follow the current law."

Local resident Matthew Qualls revealed that he once got paid to mow Mr Entrekin's lawn with a cheque that was labelled "Sheriff Todd Entrekin Food Provision Account."

Mr Qualls had spent time in prison and said usually only beans and vegetables were provided for meals. 

After he spoke out against Mr Qualls he was arrested and charged with drug trafficking. 

He was then released after a public outcry and accepted a plea deal to avoid the charge for possessing marijuana butter.
