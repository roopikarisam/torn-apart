The man accused of stabbing a woman to death inside the Winchester Public Library a week ago today has been sent to a maximum-security psychiatric hospital, officials said.


Jeffrey Yao was transferred to Bridgewater State Hospital after the Middlesex Sheriffâ€™s Office told a judge he was too mentally ill to remain in jail.
  


Yao has pleaded not guilty to murder in the death of 22-year-old Deane Kenny Stryker. Authorities say he stabbed Stryker 20 times with a hunting knife at the library in what prosecutors have called an unprovoked attack.
