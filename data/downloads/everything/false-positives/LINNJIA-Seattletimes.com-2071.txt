CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa (AP) — An Iowa county is considering its response to a lawsuit filed by an Arizona man who spent two months in jail for a robbery he didn’t commit.

The Linn County Board of Supervisors met in closed session Monday to consider the lawsuit filed by 23-year-old Joseph McBride.

The county hasn’t answered the lawsuit, which alleges County Attorney Jerry Vander Sanden signed a complaint against McBride containing false statements.

McBride was 1,500 miles away when a violent 2017 robbery occurred in Cedar Rapids, his former hometown. The victim told police that a Facebook photo of McBride appeared to match one of the assailants.

Investigators never spoke to McBride before he was arrested, shipped by prison van to Iowa, and jailed 61 days. He was released after investigators checked his alibi, which included time-stamped photos of him in Arizona.
