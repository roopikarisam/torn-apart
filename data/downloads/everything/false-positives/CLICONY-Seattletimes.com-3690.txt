LANSING, Mich. (AP) — A man accused of hiring prostitutes hundreds of times during his 20-year career as a Michigan prosecutor has been released from jail.

The Lansing State Journal reports Stuart Dunnings III walked out of the Clinton County Jail early Sunday after serving 10 months. The former Ingham County prosecutor pleaded guilty to misconduct in office and soliciting a prostitute.

Dunnings made no comment to reporters waiting outside.

He was sentenced to three years of probation, the first served in the neighboring county’s jail. He was released early for good behavior.

Many charges were dismissed. The ex-prosecutor’s arrest last year stemmed from a federal investigation into human trafficking.

Dunnings had said he was being treated for a sex addiction. He also said he “violated his oath” and “betrayed the trust” of many.
