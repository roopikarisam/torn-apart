It’s a big house indeed!

A charming former slammer is going under the hammer in upstate New York — and it’s a steal with an opening bid of $100,000.

The former Chateaugay Correctional Facility in Franklin County will be auctioned off “as is” on July 24, RoAnn Destito of the state Office of General Services said in a statement.

An Empire State listing for surplus government property touts the former medium-security prison’s location, location, location.

“The property is 10 miles from both Quebec and Ontario in Canada and stands about one-and-a-half hours from Montreal — making the region a strategic location for Canadian companies serving the U.S. market,” according to the listing.

The facility closed in July 2014 as part of Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s plan to close several prisons with declining inmate populations.

The state has sold some of its closed prisons and is trying to sell others for redevelopment.

The Chateaugay prison complex of 30 structures encompassing almost 100,000 square feet — all less than 30 years old — sits on 100 acres along Route 11.

The buildings include dorms, a dining hall, a kitchen with walk-in coolers and freezers, garages and storage units.

Among the featured amenities are water, sewer, electric and phone service, as well as a backup diesel generator and above-ground diesel and gasoline tanks.

Site tours will be conducted May 31, June 1, June 11, June 12, July 9 and July 10.

A deposit of at least $10,000 is required to lock up a bid before the cellblocks go on the auction block.
