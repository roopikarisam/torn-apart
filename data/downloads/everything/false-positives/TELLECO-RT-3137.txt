Diana Marini, 28, entered Chase Bank in Islandia, Long Island and handed a note demanding cash on Saturday afternoon, Suffolk County Police said in a statement. “The teller complied” and the woman grabbed an undisclosed amount of cash.


She fled in the taxi which was waiting for her outside. The “gangster’s” luck did not last for long, however, as police quickly tracked down the vehicle and arrested the woman. Apart from Marini, they found her 6-year-old daughter inside the car. The girl was apparently waiting in the taxi while her mother robbed the bank.

In another bizarre case, a Russian was recently sentenced to 6 years in jail after he went on a robbing spree using nothing but a snickers bar. Another person was jailed after French police found him hiding inside a suitcase on the bus from the Beauvais Airport to Paris, pilfering the passengers’ possessions.
