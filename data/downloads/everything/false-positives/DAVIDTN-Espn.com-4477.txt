Three men have been charged with attempted burglary and trespassing associated with the attempted burglary of the home of NASCAR team owner Richard Childress.


According to the Davidson County (North Carolina) Sheriff's Department, Niquan Victorin, 20, Chantz Hines, 18, and Armeka Spinks, 18 were arrested Friday after an investigation into the Dec. 17 burglary attempt of the Childress home in Lexington, North Carolina.


Bond was set at $250,000 and they are scheduled to appear in court Jan. 29 on the felony attempted burglary and misdemeanor trespassing charges.


According to the sheriff's department news release, investigators learned that three firearms matching the description of those used in the attempted Childress home invasion had been reported stolen Dec. 15 in nearby Winston-Salem.


Evidence was located connecting the three suspects to a house burglary in Winston-Salem and the Childress home, the sheriff said.


All three men face one felony charge apiece of obtaining property by false pretenses in Forsyth County (Winston-Salem) with a March 5 court date for that incident.


Childress reported to police that he shot at the suspected burglars after hearing the crash of glass at approximately 10:30 p.m. Dec. 17.


According to an earlier police statement, Childress, a first vice president of the NRA, told the sheriff that "the only reason he and his wife were here today was because of God and the Second Amendment."


The damage to the glass door was estimated at $1,000, according to the incident report.
