BETHESDA, Md., May 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- GetWellNetwork®, Inc., the Precision Engagement™ health care company, announced the recipients of its 2018 Precision Engagement Awards on April 30 during the GetConnected 2018 conference which is taking place April 30–May 2 in National Harbor, Md.

"We are immensely proud of the winners of this year's Precision Engagement awards," said Michael O'Neil, founder and CEO of GetWellNetwork. "They have collectively shown how to take patient and family engagement to the next level — by engaging individuals more fully in their own care to improve outcomes, while also enhancing the patient and family experience and increasing clinician and staff efficiency as well."
