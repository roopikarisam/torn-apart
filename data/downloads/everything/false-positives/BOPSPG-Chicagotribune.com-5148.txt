A busy week in Illinois politics lies ahead, as the Democratic candidates for governor will square off twice and Mayor Rahm Emanuel will release his 2018 budget proposal.


The mayor's administration last week began trickling out details of his plan, a typical effort to try to keep some things from getting overshadowed on speech day Wednesday.


Emanuel plans to propose $24 million in new money for police training changes and community policing expansions, an amount the administration calls a “down payment” on making reforms at the Chicago Police Department called for in a scathing federal report. His administration, though, did not say Friday where the new money will come from, except to indicate it will be included in the mayor’s overall spending package.


He also plans to make changes to how the city charges its amusement tax and to spend $500,000 more to fight Chicago's rat problem.


Meanwhile, the Democratic field for governor is down one candidate as of last week, but the remaining contenders will meet at two forums within 12 hours.


On Tuesday evening, much of the field will be at Aurora University for a forum moderated by Chicago Tribune political reporter Rick Pearson. The next morning, the candidates will be in Mount Prospect for a breakfast forum hosted by the Daily Herald and ABC 7.

It was at the Mount Prospect forum four years ago that Republican candidate Bruce Rauner summed up the forum as "beat up Brucey all morning," after his rivals, including future Senate Republican leader Bill Brady, tried to attack the primary race's front-runner and eventual winner.


 


What's on tap


*Mayor Emanuel will be at a police event in the afternoon.


*Gov. Rauner has no public schedule. Illinois first lady Diana Rauner will be doing a flu shot photo op. The governor already got his.


*Sen. Dick Durbin will hold a news conference on the congressional Republican tax plan.


*The Illinois Senate Special Committee on State and Pension Fund Investments will hold a hearing on minority and women pension investments at the Bilandic Building.


*The week ahead: On Tuesday, the state Senate pension hearing continues; Democratic governor candidates debate at night. On Wednesday, Emanuel will present his 2018 budget plan. In addition, there's the Mount Prospect Democratic governor candidate forum, and City Clerk Anna Valencia speaks to the City Club of Chicago.


 


From the notebook


*Realtors warn of loss of state and local tax deduction: As Republicans in Washington ponder changes to the nation’s tax code, there’s a serious implication for Illinois homeowners and taxpayers — the potential loss of the state and local tax deduction in exchange for a larger standard deduction.


Brian Bernardoni, senior director of government affairs and public policy at the Chicago Association of Realtors, said the impact could be felt most by families earning between $100,000 and about $330,000, as well as for elderly homeowners.


“Stripping away state and local tax deductions is a devastating thing,” Bernardoni said Sunday on WGN AM-720.


Property taxes, he said, are “such a burden for homeowners, and that relief that we get through the state and local tax deduction is the thing that will keep, for example, seniors in their homes.”


The Realtors support keeping both the mortgage interest deduction and the state and local tax deduction. But Bernardoni noted that the mortgage interest deduction amount goes down over time. As people pay down their mortgage, the amount of interest in a payment gives way to more principal.


In contrast, he said, “as your property value goes up, so do property taxes and when those things start going up, and those things go well beyond the payment of the mortgage after 30 years, you’re talking about something that's going to impact seniors, it’s going to impact housing values.”


There has been no final GOP tax plan yet presented as lawmakers in Washington work first on a federal budget. One concept would require taxpayers to choose between the mortgage interest deduction or the state and local tax deduction, but not both. Another concept would allow the state and local tax deduction only for lower incomes. (Rick Pearson)


*Pop goes Maddon: Cubs manager Joe Maddon became the latest and most unlikely participant in the Cook County pop tax debate Saturday night.


During his postgame news conference, Maddon complained about the rule that negated catcher Willson Contreras' tag of Dodger Charlie Culberson.

"That gets interpreted kind of like tantamount to the soda tax in Chicago, for me," Maddon said.


Asked later to clarify: "The soda tax, where are the Chicagoans here? Suddenly we're taxing soda back there all of a sudden. My point is all rules that are created or laws aren't necessarily good ones. That's my point."


The Cook County Board last week agreed with Maddon on the pop tax.


*On the Sunday Spin: Tribune political reporter Rick Pearson’s guests were Dr. Charles Bush-Joseph, a professor at Rush University Medical Center and former head team physician for the Chicago White Sox, on medical marijuana as an opioid alternative; Illinois Treasurer Michael Frerichs and state Rep. Rob Martwick, D-Chicago; and Brian Bernardoni, senior director of government affairs and public policy at the Chicago Association of Realtors. The Sunday Spin airs from 7 a.m. to 9 a.m. on WGN AM-720. Listen to the full show here.
