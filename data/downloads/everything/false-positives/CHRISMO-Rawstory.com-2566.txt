A Christian radio DJ in Pennsylvania has been arrested for repeatedly sexually assaulting a teen girl when she was between the ages of 15 and 18.


Lancaster Online reported Friday that DJ Phil Smith, a radio personality with Christian radio station WJTL-FM, was arrested on 18 counts related to the forcible rape and sexual assaults of the girl that began in 2013 and continued for years after.


The girl that accused Smith of the assaults told police that the DJ “committed sexual offenses against her about 10 times” at a house in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and that he raped her after she turned 18. Charges against Smith include “forcible rape, two counts of involuntary deviate sexual intercourse with a person under 16, aggravated indecent assault of a person under 16, sexual assault and 13 other offenses,” the report noted.


In a statement published after Smith’s arrest, WJTL asked listeners to “join us in praying for all those involved and that truth and justice will prevail.”


Smith’s bail was set for $250,000 after his arraignment, and is currently being held in county jail.
