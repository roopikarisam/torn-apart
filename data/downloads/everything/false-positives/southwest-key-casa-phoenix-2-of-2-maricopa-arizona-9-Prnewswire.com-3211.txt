NEW YORK, Jan. 9, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Entering its 10th year in business, Concierge Auctions maintains dominance as the choice marketplace for buyers, sellers and agents of the world's most distinguished properties. In 2017, the firm exceeded $1.5 billion in historic sales and elevated its average sale price from $3.5 million to $4.3 million. The firm's digital bidding platform processed over $4 billion in offers for properties in 24 U.S. states and 15 countries. 

"2017 was a game-changing year," stated Chairman Chad Roffers. "Now with 24/7 access to our online marketplace, buyers, sellers and agents can purchase and sell at any time, from anywhere in the world. Our private client list has grown to be the most valuable in the industry. As a result, nearly half of our bidders for every sale are activated directly from our database. Further, our analysis of our clients' digital interactions continues to guide our curation of new properties that specifically cater to their interests."


In addition to Concierge Auctions' consistent success with selling $2 million, $5 million, and $10 million-plus estates, the firm made headlines for breaking the world record for the highest-priced sale ever achieved at auction — twice, both in Europe and the U.S. In September, Concierge sold a 19th-century château in Geneva, Switzerland. Previously offered for 48 million Swiss francs (about US $47.66 million), Château de Promenthoux was designed by one of the renowned architects behind the Eiffel Tower. Just three months later, Concierge Auctions sold Walnut Place — a historic estate set on 25 prime acres in Dallas, Texas, previously offered for $48.9 million.


"After working together on almost a dozen auctions, the Concierge Auctions platform never ceases to amaze me," stated the buyer's agent of Walnut Place, Kyle Crews of Allie Beth Allman &amp; Associates. "Their global marketing outreach and high-net-worth database is unrivaled, as is their cooperation with the brokerage community. Concierge has never auctioned a property without an agent partner, which makes the sales process seamless, collaborative, and ultimately, a true partnership."


Kicking off 2017, founders Laura Brady and Chad Roffers were both named to the esteemed Inman Influencer List, a January tradition at Inman News that includes a mix of leaders who have contributed to significant change in the real estate industry. Other accolades included the firm's selection by Inc. Magazine as one of the fastest-growing companies in the U.S. for the fourth year in a row; growing traction in China, highlighted by multiple auctions specifically targeting Chinese buyers that resulted in over $120 million in sales; seven marketing awards from the National Auctioneers Association and USA Today; and seven Telly awards for innovative videography. In April, Concierge published its inaugural "Luxury Homes Days On Market Index," which was lauded for its unique insight into the country's hottest luxury markets.


"As more sellers than ever are interested in joining our marketplace, our main focus has been towards raising the caliber of our talent, processes, and technologies to support the global demand," said Concierge Auctions President Laura Brady.


Significant recent hires include Vice President of Sales Operations Betsy Roberts, who spent the past six-and-a-half years helping vacation rental marketplace HomeAway scale from a pre-IPO stage to a public company; Earl Lloyd as Director of Sales Development; Neil Stout as Director of Data Strategy and Management; and Nick Leonard's promotion to Senior Vice President of Business Development. 


While enjoying rising revenue and industry-changing recognition, the 2017 accomplishment Brady and Roffers are most proud of is Concierge Auctions' April launch of the Key for Key® giving program in cooperation with Giveback Homes. The first program of its caliber, Key for Key® guarantees that for every property the company sells, a new home will be built for a family in need. Initial efforts have been focused in Nicaragua, where the need for safe housing is critical. A total of 67 families have received new homes thus far, resulting in hundreds of lives forever changed. 


In the words of one of the program's recipients, Rafaela Tremino, "Finally, we have a place that is dry, where the rain does not get in, where we can feel safe. My four-year-old daughter and I now have hope that our life condition can change; that we can live with dignity."
