The man who was arrested on suspicion of killing Peggy Sue Case nearly 30 years ago has been extradited back to Utah and booked into the Utah County Jail.


Michael Kufrin, 61, was arrested on July 17 by the Forest Park Police Department in Illinois, where he remained until his extradition on Monday, according to a statement from the Spanish Fork Police Department.


Peggy Sue Case was reported missing in July 1988 in Spanish Fork after last being seen on July 9 with Kufrin, her boyfriend who she lived with.


Case’s remains were located on May 22 of this year in the cellar behind the residence where she and Kufrin lived.


Police used evidence and information from the 1988 investigation and newly discovered evidence to put together a warrant for Kufrin, according to the statement.


He is being held on a $250,000 cash-only bail.
