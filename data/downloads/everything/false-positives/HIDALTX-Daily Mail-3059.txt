Pharr police investigators say the teen boy's mother found an explicit text message on her son's phone back in August, KGBT-TV reported.


At the time, the boy, who is younger than 17, was dating Lopez's daughter, but he told investigators that he had sex with Lopez. 


When questioned by police in October, Lopez admitted to having sexual intercourse with the boy, court records show. 


She faces up to 20 years in prison if she is convicted on the a second-degree felony charge.
