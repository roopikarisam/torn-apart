A Marion County teacher went to jail after she bit her son, police said.

According to Turner Police Chief Don Taylor, police arrested Melissa Marie Braun, 42, of Turner, after receiving a Department of Human Services report of child abuse.

When they contacted Braun and her son, police noticed bruising from an apparent bite on the boy's lower arm, Taylor said. The boy's skin wasn't broken, he said.

"It was typical parental frustrations that probably every parent goes through," Taylor said. "She just handled them in an incorrect way."

Braun cooperated with police, and was booked into Marion County Jail on Thursday, Jan. 11, on charges of criminal mistreatment and fourth-degree assault.

Braun, a teacher at a private school, was released the following day.

"This was an incident that happened amongst family members in their own home," Taylor said. "It was not associated with where she works."
