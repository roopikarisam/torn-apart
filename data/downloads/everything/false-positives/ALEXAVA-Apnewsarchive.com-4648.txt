Colorado authorities have identified the man whose suspicious death is being investigated as a homicide and may be connected to a man arrested for the fatal carjacking of a University of Utah student.

A local Mormon leader says a University of Utah student who was killed in a carjacking attempt had converted to the faith at 16 and convinced his parents to join him.

Steve Comrie said Tuesday that 23-year-old ChenWei Guo was from Beijing and served as a missionary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Provo in 2013 and 2014.

Comrie said Guo was "the kind of person who was the fizz in the pop of life," an outgoing, gregarious person who loved hiking and the outdoors.

Guo was shot to death Monday night, touching off a manhunt for the 24-year-old suspect, Austin Boutain, who was also being sought for questioning in a Colorado homicide.


He was arrested at a Salt Lake City library following a call from a librarian.

University of Utah police chief Dale Brophy says Boutain was being questioned Tuesday.

She says Guo would speak in a moving and powerful way about his beliefs.

She said Guo loved to dance and wowed his friends on the dance floor in August at a church event for young, unmarried Chinese members of the church.

Tam says Guo was at the center of the dance floor busting out hip hop moves and was also a talented swing and ballroom dancer.

She says he was also dedicated computer science student.

Utah police say they've arrested a man sought in a fatal carjacking near the University of Utah and a Colorado homicide.

Salt Lake City Police Detective Greg Wilking said Tuesday that 24-year-old Austin Boutain turned himself in to staffers at the city library following an overnight manhunt in foothills near campus.

He was wanted in the death of a student from China who was found shot to death in his car in a rugged canyon near the University of Utah campus.

Police say they have ended a search of rugged foothills without finding a man suspected of killing a University of Utah student in a carjacking attempt.

Authorities are asking people to call police to report anything suspicious, especially involving stolen cars, in the lead-up to Halloween trick or treating.

The search was ended about 15 hours after the death of 23-year-old ChenWei Guo, a student from China.

Police in Golden, Colorado, say they want to question a man already being sought in the fatal carjacking of a University of Utah student about the killing of a 63-year-old man whose body was found in a trailer.
