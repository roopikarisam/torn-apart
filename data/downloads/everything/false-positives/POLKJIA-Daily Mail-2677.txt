Donna Byrne, 53, had a blood alcohol level of .161 while riding her horse on the freeway in Polk County, Florida

A 53-year-old woman riding a horse down a busy Florida highway has been arrested and charged with driving drunk.


Polk County Sheriff's officials said in a news release that someone called 911 about a woman, who appeared confused and possibly in danger. 


When deputies arrived they found Donna Byrne riding her horse in the road.


Officers did a sobriety test and said she gave breath samples that registered blood alcohol level of .161 - much higher than Florida's legal limit of .08.


Byrne is charged with DUI and animal neglect for endangering and failing to provide proper protection for the horse.


'Ms. Byrne was obviously not in any condition to be on the road. She not only put herself and the horse in danger, but also anyone who was driving on the road, which is typically very busy,' Sheriff Grady Judd said, according to the Orlando Sentinel. 


Deputies took the horse to the Polk County Sheriff's Animal Control livestock facility. She was booked into the Polk County Jail. 


It's unclear whether she retained an attorney.


Byrne had been arrested for charges relating to  10 misdemeanors and five felonies. Animal cruelty and drug possession were among them.
