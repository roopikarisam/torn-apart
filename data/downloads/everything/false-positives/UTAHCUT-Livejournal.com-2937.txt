Yes to Bathory! Also, I'm going to need a version of H.H. Holmes that doesn't feel like I'm watching paint dry. Sorry, Devil in the White City.

He's done nothing but take a role and yet he's still served more jail time than truly deserving pieces of shit like Allen, Spacey, HW, and Cosby likely ever will. Go figure.
