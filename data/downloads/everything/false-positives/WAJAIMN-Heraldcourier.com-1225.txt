ABINGDON, Va. — The Southwest Virginia Regional Jail Authority is requesting about $167,000 in additional funding from Washington County in the 2018-19 budget.


County Administrator Jason Berry said it has been an “ongoing trend” for the jail to ask for more money.


“This has been an ongoing ongoing trend since I’ve been here, [but] this is the worst of that five-year trend,” Berry told the Bristol Herald Courier on Thursday.


He said he learned of the additional funding request at 3:30 p.m. on Thursday, just hours before the Board of Supervisors held its budget meeting.


Board Chairman Saul Hernandez said that the jail “continues to have a dramatic impact on our budget. We had not budged that much — we have to come up with the additional money.”


Berry said that the plan will be to pay the outstanding bill for the regional jail of approximately $392,000 with the current 2017-18 fiscal-year budget and add the additional $167,000 expense into next year’s spending plan.


For the 2018-19 budget, Berry recommended providing the regional jail with $455,607, before the additional $167,000.


The extra money is needed because there are more drug-related activities, incarcerations, and state inmates housed in the regional jails. Some state inmates are staying longer than anticipated, Berry said.


Hernandez said that it costs the county $32.10 a day to have an inmate in the jail while the state only pays between $8-$10 per day for a state inmate.


“We don’t have a choice, we have to put them [state inmates] in our jail,” Hernandez said. “The state isn’t paying their fair share.”


In other business, the supervisors approved, in a 5-2 vote, maintaining the current real property tax rate at 63 cents per $100 of assessed value for the 2018 tax year. Hernandez and Supervisors Randy Pennington, Dwayne Ball, Mike Rush and Eddie Copenhaver voted in favor of maintaining the tax rate and Vice Chairwoman Allison Mays and Supervisor Phillip McCall voted against it.


McCall said that the county is “lagging” behind helping the fire and rescue services.


“A penny [tax rate increase] would go a long way in helping them out,” McCall said.


Berry said that the tax rate has not been raised for eight years.


“The tax rate has not been raised since 2010, where it was raised by five pennies,” Berry said.


According to state law, the budget and tax rate must be set by June 30. One more formal vote is needed to approve the budget before the deadline, Hernandez said.


The 2018-19 county budget totals around $125 million.
