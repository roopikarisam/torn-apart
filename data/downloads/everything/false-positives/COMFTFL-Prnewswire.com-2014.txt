ROCKVILLE, Md., May 1, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- More than 5,000 hotel owners, general managers, and hotel staff will convene today as Choice Hotels International, Inc. (NYSE: CHH), one of the world's largest hotel companies, kicks off its 64th annual convention in Las Vegas. Themed "No Limits" to mark the boundless opportunities for Choice Hotels franchisees, the three-day event focuses on listening, learning, and exchanging ideas. 

"Choice is an innovator in hospitality, franchising, and technology with the right strategy for long-term success and a focus on helping our owners maximize their return on investment," said Pat Pacious, president and CEO of Choice Hotels. "We're excited to celebrate a transformative year for Choice Hotels and talk about the opportunities ahead. Our brands continue to lead in their segments, we have the industry's most sophisticated technology, bar none, and there is continued runway for growth as the economic environment makes it a great time to build a Choice hotel." 


Attendees will participate in educational sessions on topics that explore the state of the industry, emerging trends, and the resources to optimize their business, including Choice Hotels' extensive distribution channels; award-winning loyalty program, Choice Privileges; best-in-class training program, Choice University; and powerful resources to maximize revenue. 


Choice Hotels brand leaders will host in-depth sessions on each of the company's brands, including Cambria Hotels, Comfort, the Ascend Hotel Collection, and Sleep Inn.
