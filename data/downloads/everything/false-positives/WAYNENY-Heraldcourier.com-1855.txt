BLOUNTVILLE, Tenn. — Sullivan County Sheriff Wayne Anderson carried on a longtime tradition on Friday when he donned a Santa Claus outfit and visited the inmates at the county jail.


For more than a decade, Anderson has been dressing up as Santa, in a big red coat with white trim, a hat and a white beard.


“We go into every cell block, and the pastor, he’ll have prayer with the inmates and tell them why they are here, and then we get everybody in line and let them come up,” Anderson said.


The inmates are provided a large plastic bag of toiletries and cookies.


“It’s something that we take for granted — but not the inmates. They get all excited to get shampoo, toothpaste and toothbrushes,” Anderson said.


While most of Friday’s 701 inmates won’t get out for Christmas, Anderson said he’s hoping to spread a “little good cheer.”


“I’ve always really enjoyed doing this,” Anderson said before visiting the first cell block. “These inmates are in here for a lot of bad reasons, but I still think everyone deserves some type of gift during Christmas.”


With help from Good News Jail &amp; Prison Ministry, the Sheriff’s Office provides the toiletries to the inmates. Chaplain Kent Pugh said churches provide funding and toiletries. It’s a yearlong effort, he added.


Anderson said the inmates enjoy the event and regularly ask when Santa will visit the jail. On Friday, they responded with a “thank you” and “God bless you.”


In a few of the cell blocks, the inmates volunteered to sing Christmas carols, such as “Jingle Bells,” as Anderson visited.


“They are very quiet and respectful,” Anderson said.


Earlier this week, several of the inmates prepared for the event, packing the various toiletries into bags.
