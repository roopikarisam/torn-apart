CULPEPER COUNTY, Va. (CBS19 NEWS) --  A man from Orange County is facing charges for hitting a Culpeper County deputy's patrol vehicle while driving drunk.

According to a post on its Facebook page, the Culpeper County Sheriff's Office said Sergeant Derek Emmel was traveling southbound on Route 522 in Orange County around 5:30 a.m. Sunday, when he encountered a car traveling north in the southbound lane.

Emmel swerved to the right shoulder to miss being hit head-on, and he was hit along the left-rear of his marked patrol car.

Deputies say the suspect, 25-year-old Ted Allen Herndon, Jr. of Orange County, continued driving north on Route 522 into Culpeper County.

Deputies were able to locate Herndon parked near the entrance of an old stone quarry with his headlights turned off on Algonquin Trial.

Herndon claimed to be heading home but was driving the wrong way.

Herndon was arrested and charged with his second offense of driving under the influence by the Culpeper County Sheriff's Office.

The Virginia State Police charged Herndon with felony hit-and-run. He is being held in the Culpeper County Jail without bond.

The sheriff's office said the deputy involved in the crash only received a minor injury to his shoulder and wrist, and his K-9 partner Kato was not hurt.
