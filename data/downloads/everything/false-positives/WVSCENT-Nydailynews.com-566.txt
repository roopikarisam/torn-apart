West Virginia police are searching for an inmate accused of attempted murder who wasn't reported missing until two days after he escaped.

Todd Wayne Boyes, 43, has been on the run since Wednesday morning after he somehow managed to walk out of the South Central Regional Jail in Charleston.

Police say Boyes, who was initially charged with attempted murder on a police officer, should be considered armed and dangerous.Â  Investigators are warning residents if they spot Boyes to immediately call 911 and not approach him.

State troopers told WSAZ that Boyes, of Caldwell, Ohio, left the prison around 5:50 a.m.

Jail staff didn't notice the inmate was gone until about 12:40 a.m. Friday. Authorities have been searching for Boyes ever since his disappearance was reported.

According to WSAZ, Boyes somehow obtained khaki pants, white sneakers and a dark-colored shirt.

Troopers said he changed clothes in his cell and then walked out of the jail. A photo shows him with a bald head, clean shaven face and glasses.

Boyes was scheduled to be sentenced Friday after he pleaded guilty to having a stolen vehicle, fleeing police and causing bodily harm in a February incident. At the time, he was wanted for several carjackings in Ohio.

He was arrested after he rammed his car into a police cruiser sending an officer to the hospital. The attempted murder charge was dropped in September after he accepted a plea deal, according to the Wichita Eagle.

Police said they are not concentrating the search on a specific area and so far have no solid leads.
