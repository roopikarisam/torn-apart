FULL TITLE: Ohio boy, 10, is charged with a felony after 'leading police on a 45-mile chase that reached speeds of 100mph' 


A 10-year-old Ohio boy has been charged with felony fleeing and eluding after allegedly leading police and state troopers on a 45-mile pursuit that reached speeds of 100mph because he was 'bored'. 


Erie County Prosecutor Kevin Baxter says a judge will hold a hearing Friday to determine if the boy should remain in a juvenile detention center. 


The boy took his mother's boyfriend's car from his Cleveland home on Thursday and led police on a high-speed interstate pursuit that continued with state troopers chasing him on the Ohio Turnpike, according to authorities.

“It’s fun to do bad things.”

Too many video games

 That boy lacks basic common sense in so many ways I can't even count them.


Beat the kids ass till it is black and blue. Ground him for a month. After that get him a track license. Kid could be heading to hell, but lets give him the other option.

Even more this is the second time in two weeks he’s done this. Why was he not in juvy hall before now?

Can a convicted felon drive in NASCAR? This kid has a future.

“...He allegedly kicked at the troopers and spit on them off camera, state patrol Lt Richard Reeder told Cleveland.com.”

This kid sounds like a future NFL player. He would fit right in kneeling with all the other losers.

And if the parents won’t ...... I am okay with the police doing it. Same for adults that can’t act civilized.

I’m guessing that’s already happened and the kid is lashing out at Mommy’s boyfriend.

Too many video games, indeed. What a sorry little punk.

This was the second time in the past few days. The first time he cost mama’s boyfriend (you knew there’d be one) 3 new tires. If I’d done that, I’d have had my butt beat so hard I wouldn’t be able to sit in a car, much less take it for another joy ride. I’d also be raking leaves and shoveling snow around the neighborhood to pay for those tires. I’d be shining those cops shoes for the next six months for spitting on them.

This up and coming rapper will be spending the next 95% of his life in jail. The other 5% will be spent breaking the law and endangering the lives of others.

 Maybe they cut him some slack the first time, because with three out of four tires flat, he couldn't get sufficient speed or control to accomplish a REALLY GOOD high-speed chase scene. 


 (Do I need the /sarc?)


“Im guessing thats already happened and the kid is lashing out at Mommys boyfriend.”

I’m figuring the same. Not excusing his behavior just saying things would probably be a lot different if his real father was around.

Get that kid a trans am license and put him on the circuit. :-)

Spare the rod and spoil the child.

Yes. I think it was smart psychopaths likeTed Bundy who stole a car at 4 years of age and put police on a chase. Some kids have too gifted for their own good

Yes, he could have easily killed several people.
