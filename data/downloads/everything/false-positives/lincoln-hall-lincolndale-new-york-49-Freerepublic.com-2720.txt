The Lincoln Hall dorm at Eastern Illinois University may be renamed because its counterpart at the school  Douglas Hall  has come under fire. 


The universitys faculty senate recently passed a resolution calling on campus leaders to consider renaming the two dorms because Stephen Douglas, a Democrat, famously advocated for slavery against Republican Abraham Lincoln in a series of debates.

Poor Mr. Douglas. His advocating of popular sovereignty cost him the Democratic nominee as the Southern states thought he was not Pro-Slavery enough but today Douglas is considered in the same category as Calhoun and Davis.

Will these schools ever wake up and immediately EXPEL the troublemakers instead of entertaining their childish silly demands?

They will now be called ‘Che’ and ‘Fidel’ Dorms.......................

Are they ignorant of what Lincoln had to say about slavery during the debates?

In all fairness, neither of these two Neanderthals were strong enough advocates for the LGBT community.

Sheesh! What do you suppose they will rename Lincoln’s tomb to?

Maybe, “Tomb of some jive racist cracker what gave us the right to call him a jive racist cracker”

Lincoln was a racist. Which is an understatement. Lincoln was KKK Grand Wizard racist.

How about renaming them Dorm 1 and Dorm 2

Total rubbish, off your meds again, are you?

Lincoln invited free Black ministers to the White House to have a conversation. Lincoln did not hesitate to convince them of their inferiority when he candidly said the following: You and we are different races. We have between us a broader difference than exists between almost any other two races. Whether it is right or wrong I need not discuss, but this physical difference is a great disadvantage to us both, as I think your race suffers very greatly, many of them, by living among us, while ours suffers from your presence. In a word, we suffer on each side. If this is admitted, it affords a reason at least why we should be separated. 


Lincoln was, indeed, a white supremacist. In his 1858 debate with Sen. Steven Douglas, Lincoln maintained, And inasmuch as they cannot so live, while they do remain together there must be the position of superior and inferior, and I as much as any other man am in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race. 


Lincoln was no supporter of racial equality. In fact, while debating Douglas in 1858, Lincoln declared the following: I will say then that I am not, nor ever have been in favor of bringing about in any way the social and political equality of the white and black races. 


Being that Lincoln was a not concerned with racial equality or the well-being of Black slaves in the South, it should come as no surprise that he did not support the marital union of whites and Blacks. He, in 1858, remarked, I have never had the least apprehension that I or my friends would marry negroes if there was no law to keep them from it, but as Judge Douglas and his friends seem to be in great apprehension that they might, if there were no law to keep them from it, I give him the most solemn pledge that I will to the very last stand by the law of this State, which forbids the marrying of white people with negroes. 


 There is a natural disgust in the minds of nearly all white people to the idea of indiscriminate amalgamation of the white and black races  A separation of the races is the only perfect preventive of amalgamation, but as an immediate separation is impossible, the next best thing is to keep them apart where they are not already together. If white and black people never get together in Kansas, they will never mix blood in Kansas

The further we go, we can find many flaws in our heroes as we enjoy easier times, reaping the benefits of their struggles and mistakes. At the end of the day, on the pedestal they have put us on, is it just to look down on them and forget them?

Didn’t Tony Romo go there?

I absolutely HATE IT when people judge History by the mores of today. History should be viewed by the mores of the time in which it occurred.....who were the good guysand the bad guys AT THAT TIME??

So are they now going to destroy all Lincoln statues?

Zero respect for history... with the modern University mindset they should rename the dorms ‘dumb and dumber’... it would fit.

Lincoln and Douglas held one of the 7 Great Debates of 1858 in Charleston (near the Fairgrounds I believe). Unbelievable the university would turn their backs on this. They might as well rename the universities iconic Old Main building “Snowflake Central”

Piddiful. Just piddiful

These stupid, evil, lazy posers ought to all be fired. I was a president of a faculty senate and had to work like a Trojan to accomplish something worthwhile and keep the administration accountable.

These Eastern Illinois shmucks are just playing professor. Since they’re heavily unionized, they don’t have to teach. They just have to be offensive, sagging, activists.

 That ought to make the snowflakes feel better.
