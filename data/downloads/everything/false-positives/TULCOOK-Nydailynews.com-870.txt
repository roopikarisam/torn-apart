An Oklahoma man was not laughing when the Mark Wahlberg comedy flick “Ted” almost landed him in jail.

Lonnie Perry was facing a $218 bill for a DVD that he rented in the Tulsa, Okla., area back in 2014. He paid as little as $5 for the rental, but later became homeless and forgot to return the movie.

“Just a regular weekday,” he told KTUL. “I went home from work, stopped by and rented a movie, then went home and watched it."

When he became homeless, he said he put everything in a box, including the movie. He did not think about the talking teddy bear again until he got a call from the Rogers County district attorney’s office and then a letter, according to the station.

DVDs may have mostly gone out of style, but this one would now cost Perry $218.07.

“I just don’t have that kind of money right off,” he told the station. “I’ll get it, and I’ll pay it. I’ll do what I have to do. I just think it could have gone a different route.”

Perry was facing a trip to jail if he did not pay up. Fortunately, local handyman company Jeff of All Trades paid the entire bill to the rental store, according to the station.

Perry does not have a glowing review of the movie, which grossed more than $200 million when it came out in 2012.

“It wasn’t worth the $5 I rented it for,” he told the station.
