The owner of an assisted living facility north of Longmont who was convicted of defrauding elderly residentsÂ has been sentenced to one year of jail work-release and 10 years of probation.

Christopher Allen Butler, 60, was sentenced last week on three counts of theft from an at-risk elder and one count of felony theft. Butler was found guilty of the charges at a trial earlier this year.

Work-release allows inmates to leave the Boulder County Jail during the day to work before they return to spend their nights and weekends in custody.

Butler was found not guilty of two additional counts of theft from an at-risk elder, and prosecutors originally had dismissed numerous other counts of theft, identity theft and fraud.

Butler owned Timberline Lodge, an assisted living facility at 9198 Jotipa Drive in unincorporated Boulder County.
