TULSA, Okla. (AP) â€” A judge has denied an Oklahoma man's request for immunity from prosecution for a first-degree murder charge under the state's "stand your ground" law.


The Tulsa World reports that 45-year-old William Wolverton Bridges faces charges in connection to the shooting death of 34-year-old Christopher Coffelt at his Tulsa home in February. Tulsa County District Judge William Musseman ruled Wednesday that the "stand your ground" law doesn't apply to Bridges' case because Coffelt was unarmed when he was shot.


Musseman said the defense failed to establish that Coffelt was an intruder at Bridges' residence during the shooting. Musseman also said that Bridges had marijuana in the house, which is a misdemeanor offense in Oklahoma.

Bridges is being held in Tulsa Jail. A status conference is scheduled for Dec. 20.
