SMITHFIELD, Utah (AP) — Law enforcement authorities in northern Utah are accusing a man of throwing sulfuric acid on a child.


The Deseret News reports 32-year-old Smithfield resident Jason Keith Summers was arrested Friday on charges including child abuse and trespassing.


A Cache County Jail booking affidavit shows Summers walked into a neighbor's property "before throwing a substance on the child."


The record shows Summers told investigators he threw "dirt" on the child, but authorities later discovered it was sulfuric acid.


The record states Summers told police he had used drugs that day. He later undid the seatbelt and got out of a moving police vehicle through a window as he was being taken to jail.


The affidavit does not say how seriously the child was injured.


Jail records do not list an attorney.
