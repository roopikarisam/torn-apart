A Florida Keys firefighter smashed a glass mason jar in the face of a man who tried to grope his wife at a bar, according to a police report.

Monroe County sheriff’s deputies arrested Islamorada Fire Rescue Department Captain Lester Robert Young for using a mason jar to hit Jose Fernando Benitez Diaz Sunday morning, the Miami Herald reported.

Young admitted to also repeatedly punching Diaz in the face to the point that “blood [was] coming from his mouth, cheeks, eye orbits and forehead,” the police report noted.

Diaz allegedly approached Young’s wife at the Morada Bay Beach Cafe and tried to stick his hand up her skirt. When Young’s wife spotted him again in the parking lot, she got upset and told her husband about it.

According to three witnesses, Young ran up to Diaz and began beating him up in the parking lot.

“Then she saw him in the parking lot and got upset,” Young told deputies, according to the report. “I lost it and attacked him.”

Diaz’s injuries were so severe he had to be taken to Ryder Trauma Center. Police took Young to Monroe County Detention Center where he was charged with aggravated battery.
