SALT LAKE CITY (AP) â€” Health officials say at least 75 people are part of a large hepatitis A outbreak that began in May.

The Salt Lake Tribune reported Sunday that many of the cases originated in Salt Lake County.

According to state Health Department data, a majority of those infected are men and 17 people contracted the disease while in jail.

Hepatitis A is a viral disease that inflames the liver.

People are typically infected after eating or drinking food or water contaminated by infected feces or touching their mouths with unclean hands.

Health department spokesman Nicholas Rupp says the homeless population is especially vulnerable to the disease because they frequently lack access to restrooms and sinks.

Over half of the people infected in Utah have required hospitalization.

Officials say no one has died.
