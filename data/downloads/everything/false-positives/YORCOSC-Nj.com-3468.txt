A 76-year-old West New York man has been charged with threatening to cut the throat of a man at a town senior center after repeatedly entering the facility and harassing him, authorities say.

The alleged victim told police that on multiple occasions over a span of more than a year, Ephrain Garcia, of 56th Street, entered the center, cursed at him and once assaulted him, the criminal complaint says.

The alleged victim said on the morning of June 19, Garcia entered the senior center and this time motioned with his hand across his throat and said he was going to cut the man's throat and kill him, the complaint says.

Garcia was escorted out by staff and a complaint against him was signed that day, the complaint says, adding that all previous incidents have been reported to police.

Garcia, who made his first appearance Friday in Criminal Justice Reform Court via video link from Hudson County jail, was charged with making terroristic threats.



At the hearing, the state moved to detain Garcia through the course of his prosecution. A detention hearing is set for today before Hudson County Superior Court Judge Paul DePascale.
