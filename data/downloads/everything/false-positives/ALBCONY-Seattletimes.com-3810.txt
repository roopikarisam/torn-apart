ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — A convicted sex offender whose escape from police caused a 13-day manhunt 23 years ago is getting out of prison.

The Glens Falls Post-Star reports that 57-year-old Joel O’Keefe is scheduled to be released to Washington County social services on Nov. 25.

O’Keefe escaped from state police in Saratoga County in September 1994 as he was being transported back to jail from court. He was recaptured at a Subway shop in Bennington, Vermont, where a clerk recognized him.

A state corrections spokesman says O’Keefe’s conditional release has been delayed because of disciplinary issues including at least three attempted escapes.

Corrections authorities say O’Keefe used a water pistol painted black in a 2001 escape attempt as he was transported back to Southport Correctional Facility in Elmira from a medical appointment.
