Blizzard has revealed the totals for sales of the Pink Mercy Overwatch skin, which was sold to raise money for the Breast Cancer Research Foundation (BCRF). The $14.99 skin, which was sold between May 8-21, 2018, made over $12.7 million for BCRF. As noted by the company in their official update, “This is the largest donation by a corporate partner within one year in BCRF’s 25-year history, and it’s all because of you.”

 

In addition to the amount raised through skin sales, Blizzard revealed how much money was raised through the other BCRF charity promotions. Over $130,000 came in from the VICKISIGH Pink Mercy limited edition t-shirts and donations made during the 14 Overwatch stars’ Twitch streams. 

 

Overwatch is available for the PlayStation 4, Xbox One and PC.
