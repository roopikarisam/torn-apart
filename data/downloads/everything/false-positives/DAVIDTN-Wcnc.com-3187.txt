SALISBURY, N.C. -- A bank robbery suspect was shot by an officer after leading police on a chase and stabbing a citizen, authorities in Rowan County said Thursday.


It all began around 12:30 p.m. at First National Bank at 322 E. Innes Street in Salisbury. Police told NBC Charlotte the suspect got away with money then officers pursued the getaway vehicle to Thomasville in Davidson County.

Police said the driver left the vehicle and tried to run into Anderson RC Hobby Shop on Mendenhall Street, but a citizen stood in the way. The suspect then stabbed that citizen several times, according to officers.


The suspect was shot by a Salisbury Police officer after tasers proved ineffective. A second suspect was treated at the hospital for an unrelated medical issue.


The suspects' and citizen's names were not released. In an afternoon news conference, authorities said the injuries of the suspect who was shot appeared to be serious, while the injuries of the citizen who was stabbed were not considered life-threatening.


Several agencies responded to the incident including Salisbury Police Department, Rowan County Sheriff, Davidson County Sheriff and Thomasville Police Department.
