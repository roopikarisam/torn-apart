WASHINGTON COUNTY (KFTA) - A man is behind bars after leading authorities on a high-speed chase reaching speeds of nearly 95 miles an hour.


Goshen Police tells FOX24, William Howard is at the Washington County Detention Center following a chase that took place late Monday night.


Police say an officer initially noticed a small, white GMC truck tailgating the vehicle in front of it while driving east bound on highway 45.

According to Rone, Howard drove through the woods and crashed about 40 feet down into a ravine and attempted to swim away.


Police arrested Howard who is facing charges of aggravated assault and felony fleeing among others.


Rone says no officers were hurt.
