 Schoolgirl killer Sean Price has been handed an extra three years’ jail for breaching a supervision order by raping a woman days after the homicide.

The sentence takes his total jail term to 41 years and means the 33-year-old will now not be eligible for parole until after 39 years and five months.

Price appeared in the county court of Victoria on Thursday via video link to hear his sentence but Judge Meryl Sexton disconnected him from the hearing when he began playing up and making offensive gestures.

She earlier refused his request to personally make a “commentary” to the court, given he was already legally represented.

Price pleaded guilty to breaching a 10-year supervision order when he raped a woman in a Christian bookshop, shortly after killing schoolgirl Masa Vukotic by stabbing her 49 times in March 2015.

He admitted committing the rape purely for gratification because he knew he would be locked up for the murder for a long time, Sexton said.

Price was jailed for life in 2016 for the rape and murder, to be eligible for parole in 2053 when aged 70.

But on Thursday Sexton jailed him for an extra three years for the supervision order breach. She set a new non-parole period of 39 years and five months.

“I find there is no remorse,” she said. “You are now and will remain a significant danger to the community for the immediate future.”
