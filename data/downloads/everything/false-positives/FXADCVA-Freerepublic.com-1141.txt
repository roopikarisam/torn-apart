 The investigation revealed Goodwin House Baileys Crossroads, a retirement community in the 3400 block of South Jefferson Street, was not the intended target, but rather the victim of reckless behavior. 


 Throughout February, our officers responded to a number of calls within the Baileys Crossroads area for sounds of gunshots and damage to apartments consistent with gunfire. Windows of three apartments within the retirement complex were hit by bullets. No one was injured in any of the cases. 


 Officers and detectives worked around the clock to place the appropriate charges. We appreciate the extensive cooperation of Goodwin House management, security staff, and residents. People who live and work in the area were also instrumental in providing statements and video surveillance to help with the investigation.

Dreamers? MS-13? or both?

Reckless behavior and no intent to harm? But held without bond? Okaaaay. Either something pretty bad popped on these guys and/or they’re illegals.

“Nehemias Perez Escobar, 35, and Irvin Rodriguez Perez, 23, both from the Falls Church area of Fairfax County”

Define the word “from”

 Sure they are.


They let them go to encourage more shootings,
more murders, more rapes.

“Falls Church men”. :-/

“Reckless behavior and no intent to harm? But held without bond?”

At one point in time, and perhaps it still is... A felony to discharge a firearm into a dwelling. But according to this article it’s not called out as a felony, I may be mistaken but I have a relative whose house was shot accidentally by an unknown source and the police were out there conducting a felony investigation, but that was in the Roanoke area I do not know if Fairfax County has the same caveat applied/regarding that type of a crime.

They are just shooting the seniors that Americans won’t shoot!

Betcha if ICE pays an unannounced visit to their "home" in the Falls Church area there'll be about 25 DREAMers jumping out of the windows and running away.


how do they afford to live in Falls Church???

Escobar and Perez should have become residents of Cedar Falls/Waterloo, Dubuque or Des Moines... Catholic or Lutheran charities would bail them out and give them a couple of bucks to buy more cerveza.

 Three bedroom house, 25 illegals living there (mattresses all over the floors), split up the rental 25 ways. 


 Until ICE broke up a similar situation in my neighborhood, that's how it was near me.


FWIW, I think this is less about the charge than the no bond. Even accused felons get bond. Either these guys have done something else, they’re illegals, or bith.

Just shooting out the windows, Americans dont want to shoot out!

 I pick Door Number 3 





Looking like the fine upstanding citizens they are

Yep.

A relatively light charge with no bond. Even illegals get bond on more serious charges than this. More to this story is coming.

I’ve seen a lot of that lately. Crime blotter stories of guys with light charges held with no bond. Then the stories disappear down the memory hole. 3 guesses what the perps all have in common...
