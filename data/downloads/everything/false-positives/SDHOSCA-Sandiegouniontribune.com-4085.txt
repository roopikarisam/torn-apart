A 59-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of stabbing a woman who offered him a Gatorade in the Shelltown community on Saturday night, San Diego police said.


The man was rummaging through a shopping cart on Main Street near Vesta Street when the victim tried to give him the drink about 8:30 p.m., San Diego police Officer Robert Heims said.


The man is suspected of spinning around, kicking the woman in the leg and stabbing her in the right hip, Heims said.


When police arrived, the suspect was still in the area and was arrested in connection with the attack. The 45-year-old victim was taken to a hospital with injuries that weren’t life-threatening.
