According to The Blast, Naya Rivera has probably given her lawyer a case of déjà-vu by filing for divorce from her estranged husband Ryan Dorsey for the second time.  Naya filed for divorce in Los Angeles on Tuesday, citing “irreconcilable differences.” She’s asking for joint legal and physical custody of their 2-year-old son Josey, and has also requested the judge block both of them from getting spousal support.

Naya lists the date of separation as November 24th, 2017. That’s one day before she was arrested and charged with domestic battery for beating on Ryan during a Thanksgiving weekend walk. So she claims they broke up on Black Friday? That’s probably not the first time someone has decided to break up on Black Friday. “You really think I’m lining up at 4am for a damn Roku player? Yeah, this isn’t going to work.”


Naya and Ryan dated two different times. Naya filed to end her two year long marriage in November 2016, but called it off two months ago. And now she’s filed for divorce a second time. It feels like the number two is a theme for these two (no pun intended). If that’s the case, I really hope the two-theme ends with this second divorce filing. Because I’m sure Naya doesn’t want to spend the next family holiday in a police station. But maybe just ho ho hold up on the spiked egg nog this Christmas, just in case, Naya.
