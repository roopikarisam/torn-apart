Jan. 11 (UPI) -- Teen Mom 2 alum Kieffer Delp was arrested Wednesday after police discovered a suspected meth lab in his home.

The 28-year-old was charged with operating a working methamphetamine laboratory after authorities found chemicals and other items in his basement apartment in McKees Rocks, Pa., according to the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.


Police entered Delp's home with a search warrant after receiving information about a suspected meth lab. Authorities had started investigating a few weeks prior following multiple complaints about the apartment.

TMZ reported police evacuated Delp's building during the arrest because of "a strong, lingering odor inside." Residents were permitted to return to their units Thursday morning, according to the Post-Gazette.

Delp is being held in the Allegheny County Jail after failing to post a $50,000 bail. He faces felony charges related to the manufacturing and distribution of methamphetamine and the improper disposal of chemicals.

Delp is an ex-boyfriend of Teen Mom 2 star Jenelle Evans.
