A North Carolina man was arrested Wednesday after officials said he threatened to urinate on deputies.

Cristopher Chase Watson, 33, called 911 on Wednesday and began to cuss and argue with dispatchers, according to a news release from the Davidson County Sheriff’s Office. 

Watson, of Lexington, then threatened to pee on the faces of responding deputies, officials said.

The threats weren’t carried out when deputies arrived to Watson’s home off NC Highway 150, and found him “highly intoxicated.”
