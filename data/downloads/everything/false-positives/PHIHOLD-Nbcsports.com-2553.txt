The reactions will only continue as the week goes on after President Donald Trump disinvited the Eagles to the White House a day before the Super Bowl champions were scheduled to visit (see story).

Politicians with local ties made their voices heard Monday night, while the president also sent out a tweet restating his stance behind the decision (see story).

Some current and former NFL players also chimed in on the news.

"I guess he was upset with the delegation we were sending," Eagles safety Rodney McLeod said of Trump's decision in a text message to NBC Sports Philadelphia's Derrick Gunn.

Former Eagle Torrey Smith, who played a key role in the team's Super Bowl run, tweeted:

There are a lot of people on the team that have plenty of different views. The men and women that wanted to go should’ve been able to go. It’s a cowardly act to cancel the celebration because the majority of the people don’t want to see you. To make it about the anthem is foolish

So many lies smh Here are some facts 1. Not many people were going to go2. No one refused to go simply because Trump “insists” folks stand for the anthem  3. The President continues to spread the false narrative that players are anti military pic.twitter.com/89GUNhJ4eE

Let me get this straight so YALL President saw that a few players from the Eagles wasn’t showing up tomorrow so he got sensitive and and cancelled the whole trip? 😂 Man get this bum out of here! Correct me if I’m wrong didn’t Eagles players stand for the anthem all year? 🤔

Don’t Matter most of the guys weren’t going anyway!

Why is this impeachment taking so Damn Long 😒

• Eagles release statement after invite rescinded

• Eagles saw honor of White House visit

• Trump's anthem comments put Eagles in tough spot

• Lurie's statement on anthem policy fell short

• Jenkins, Long don't hold back on anthem policy

• Wentz was open to going to White House

• Jenkins didn't see visit as 'beneficial'

• How anthem policy affects Eagles

We’re just two weeks away from Eagles training camp and there will be two chances for fans to see the Super Bowl champions practice this summer. 

The Eagles are holding two open practices during this year’s training camp that will require free tickets. 

The tickets are new this year and are all general admission. Those wishing to attend one of the practices must get tickets from ticketmaster.com starting at 10 a.m. on July 18. Seating will be first-come, first-serve. 

The Eagles say there will also be other free activities on those days, including face painting, alumni autographs and green screen photos. 

Parking for both open practices will also be free. 

The Eagles report for training camp on July 25 and the first team practice will be on July 26 at the NovaCare Complex. All but those two open dates will be held at the NovaCare Complex and will be open to only select season ticket holders and partners. 

Two of the Eagles’ three scheduled off days during training camp will be held before an open practice. 

Training camp officially ends on Aug. 14. The preseason begins on Aug. 9 at home against the Steelers. 

Are the 2018 Eagles better or worse along the defensive line?

Are 2018 Eagles better or worse at tight end?

Pederson's rise to leader of Super Bowl champs still hard to believe

We finally saw the new Madden 19 player ratings yesterday. And … no surprise … there are plenty of reasons for the Eagles to feel like underdogs again, even after winning the Super Bowl. 

Enrico hit on this already (see story), mentioning that Carson Wentz is the 10th rated QB in the league with an 86 rating, while Nick Foles got an 80. 

“The game developers must not have watched the Super Bowl,” Enrico quipped.

Perhaps not. 

But this just highlights a problem we’ve run into with Foles since his incredible performance in the playoffs and Super Bowl LII. It’s impossible to rate or rank him. 

Madden clearly didn’t know how to do it. In fact, there are 21 quarterbacks with a higher rating in the new game than Foles, including Case Keenum, Tyrod Taylor and rookie Baker Mayfield, who were all 81s. Gross. 

That’s right, two Browns quarterbacks — including a rookie — have higher ratings than Foles. And Foles is just one point higher than Sam Bradford. After winning the Super Bowl MVP. 




How is Foles’ awareness rating just an 87? The man called the Philly Special!

Overall, it seems crazy that Foles would be that low. But it’s as tough to figure out where to put him on the list of quarterbacks in today’s game as it is to determine his legacy. 

Because he’s an absolute legend in Philly. If Eagles fans did the Madden ratings, Foles would have had a smooth 100 only because they couldn’t give out a 120/100. You know the deal; he’ll never buy a beer in Philly again. 

On the flip side, Foles has started just four regular season games over the past two years and that comes after his disastrous 2015 in St. Louis. He obviously had a tremendous three-game playoff run, but does it completely erase all of the last three seasons? In Philly, the answer in an unequivocal yes. Around the country, it seems it’s going to take a little more time. It seems like on a national scale, folks are going to want to see Foles duplicate his playoff success as a full-time starter. And some idiots apparently think Foles isn't up to the pressure of being a starter again.

That's just silly. 

But this is all just figuring out how to rank Foles right now. Figuring out his legacy is even trickier. 

Earlier this offseason, I began discussing with Reuben Frank whether or not Foles is a top-10 Eagle of all-time. That discussion blew up. Some folks think it’s a no-brainer; of course he is, he won a Super Bowl and there’s also 27-2. But others understandably tried to look at the entire body of work. It’s not an easy decision; although most of you probably have an opinion. 

I’m not sure that debate will ever get any easier. Because if all goes to plan, Foles’ career as an Eagle will pretty much be over. Wentz will take over and lead the franchise, while Foles has probably already done what he’s going to do in an Eagles uniform. Perhaps, if Wentz wins multiple Super Bowls, it’ll devalue Foles’ performance in Super Bowl LII. But that seems unlikely; that first one will always be the most special. 

It all just leaves us to our own opinions on Foles, how he ranks right now and all-time, and it’s impossible to separate emotion. So feel free to see that 80 next to Foles' name in a video game and scoff, “Have some respect for the Super Bowl MVP!”
