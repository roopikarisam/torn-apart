Former NFL lineman Jonathan Martin was taken into police custody Friday after posting a threat on his Instagram Stories:

Martin threatened to shoot up Harvard-Westlake School, which is a prominent L.A. high school that he also happens to be an alumnus of.


The threat ended up shutting down the school, and police told CBS Los Angeles that the closure was the result of "a former student, now an adult, who made threats in an Instagram post Thursday."


According to the LA Daily News:


“We have confirmed that he’s been located —  the suspect, in this case,” Sgt. Frank Albarran of the Los Angeles Police Department’s North Hollywood Division said around noon. “He’s not a threat anymore.”

The man was located in Southern California and detained pending further investigation by LAPD’s Major Crimes Division, he said. Albarran did not immediately know whether the man, who is believed to be in his late 20s, would be arrested or face any charges.

While the Daily News did not name Martin in its article, ABC 7 stated a "former Dolphins player is in custody."


A few years ago, Martin suffered an "emotional breakdown" after he was bullied by Richie Incognito and several other Dolphins teammates.
