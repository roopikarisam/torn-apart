DANNEMORA, N.Y. (AP) â€” Authorities say a woman has been charged with having sexual contact with an inmate at the same New York prison where another female employee aided the escape of two killers.

State police say the charges against former Clinton Correctional Facility employee Denise Prell include promoting prison contraband and sexual abuse.

Investigators say the 38-year-old was fired last month two years into her civilian job as an industrial training supervisor at the maximum-security prison after a guard saw her engaged in inappropriate behavior with an inmate.


She's being held in the county jail on $10,000 cash bail. It couldn't be determined if she has a lawyer.

In June 2015, two inmates escaped from the prison near the Canadian border with the help of civilian employee Joyce Mitchell. One was killed by police, and the other was captured.

Mitchell is serving a prison term.
