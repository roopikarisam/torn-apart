A California mother has been arrested for the murder of her own two-year-old son after she told police the boy had drowned at their home.


First responders were called to the San Bernardino County home of Crystal Greene, 30, at 4:16pm on Friday after she called in the boy's supposed drowning.


He was rushed to a local hospital, where doctors found that the boy had suffered from 'numerous injuries,' a police statement said.

It's currently unclear how Green's son had supposedly drowned in their home on the 10300 block of Wintergreen Road in Pinon Hills. 


But after failing to resuscitate the boy and declaring him dead, staff at Desert Valley Hospital noticed what they believed to be injuries sustained by the child.


They then called in the San Bernardino Sheriff's Department's Homicide and Crimes Against Children Investigators, who interviewed Greene and arrested her.


San Bernardino County Sheriff's Office said that the child had 'not drowned' but declined to release other details in the case. 


Greene remains in custody on no bail and will go to court on Tuesday for a video arraignment.


Her three other children have been taken into the custody of Children and Family Services.


The children were 'uncooperative' with officers at the scene, according to scanner traffic picked up by the Victor Valley Daily Press. 


Police are asking anyone with information to contact Detective Kevin McCurdy at (909) 387-3589.
