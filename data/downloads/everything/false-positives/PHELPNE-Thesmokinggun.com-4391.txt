Meet Rebecca Lynn Phelps.

The 30-year-old Floridian is jailed on a battery charge after she allegedly became angry and struck a male acquaintance in the face when he declined to have sex with her, cops report.

Officers responded to Phelps’s New Port Richey home around 2 AM yesterday, according to a complaint affidavit.

Phelps and the victim had been drinking outside her residence when she “started to get mad with the victim because he did not want to have sexual relations with her.” Phelps then allegedly “started to scream and smack the victim.”

Phelps also scratched the man’s right arm, drawing blood. She had the victim's skin under her nails when she was examined by deputies.

During police questioning, Phelps “stated nothing happened” and said she did not know what caused the man to bleed. A witness who was inside the residence at the time of the confrontation told police that he heard the victim yell to Phelps, “Please stop hitting me,” and “then he heard a smack.”

Pictured above, Phelps was arrested for misdemeanor battery and booked into the county jail, where she is locked up on $500 bond. A judge has ordered her to have no contact with the victim.
