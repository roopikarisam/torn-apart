PITTSBORO, Miss. (AP) — An inmate who escaped his work detail has been captured in Mississippi.

News outlets report that Calhoun County Sheriff Greg Pollan says deputies acting on a tip captured Randall Scott Willis on Sunday evening, two days after he walked away from his work detail at Calhoun County Solid Waste on Friday afternoon.

Pollan says Willis was in the Calhoun County jail on charges of burglary and resisting arrest.

Further details have not been released.

It’s unclear if Willis has a lawyer.
