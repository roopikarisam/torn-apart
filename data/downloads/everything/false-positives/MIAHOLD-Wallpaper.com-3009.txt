Design Miami 2017 preview




The 13th edition of Design Miami (6-10 December) will soon be in full swing as the global creative community descends on the city, all in the name of design and art – and the Floridian sun and sea, of course. This year sees an energised focus on the expanding Design District, with a flock of new boutiques, restaurants, and Paradise Plaza almost doubling the creative neighbourhood’s footprint from last year. The art scene, too, has much cause to celebrate, with the recent reopening of local institutions. Here, we map out the unmissable exhibitions and events, so you can get Miami’s teenage kicks right through the night.
