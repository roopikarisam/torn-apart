Two-time All-Star, 1986 World Series MVP, and current Washington Nationals TV analyst Ray Knight was arrested for assault and battery over the weekend, according to the Fairfax County Police Department. Police say that officers were called to Knight’s home at 4:00 a.m. on Sunday after an argument between Knight and a 33-year-old male acquaintance turned into a fight.


Both Knight and the other man were treated at the hospital, with Knight then taken to a detention center. He was released and has a scheduled court date of Jan. 8, 2018.


Knight is currently an in-studio analyst for the Nationals’ regional sports network. He achieved fame as a player first with the Cincinnati Reds, and most notably with the New York Mets, where he had several key hits in the 1986 World Series and was the winning run that scored on Mookie Wilson’s ground ball through Bill Buckner’s legs.
