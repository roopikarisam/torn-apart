Nick Allen and Ben Riley-Smith of The Telegraph report that James Woolhouse, the executive vice president and chief operating officer of publishing conglomerate Condé Nast International—in charge of such periodicals as Vogue, Wired, Vanity Fair, and Glamour—sent an e-mail on Monday, October 23, to “country presidents” stating that the company will no longer be working with fashion photographer Terry Richardson, and that any projects already commissioned from Richardson but as of yet not published can be “killed or substituted with other material.” The directive comes in the wake of an article published on October 22 by the Sunday Times that asks why Richardson, who has faced multiple accusations of sexually abusing and exploiting models over the years, is still being celebrated by the fashion industry.


In 2014, when the accusations against the photographer resurfaced, he published a letter in the Huffington Post defending himself and his work, specifically in regards to the 2004 exhibition “Terryworld” at Deitch Projects in New York and the similarly titled book released that year to coincide with show: “I collaborated with consenting adult women who were fully aware of the nature of the work, and as is typical with any project, everyone signed releases. I have never used an offer of work or a threat of rebuke to coerce someone into something that they did not want to do. I give everyone that I work with enough respect to view them as having ownership of their free will and making their decisions.”


Richardson has shot ad campaigns for Marc Jacobs, Yves Saint Laurent, and Tom Ford, and has worked with many celebrities, including Lady Gaga, Beyoncé, and Miley Cyrus. Richardson directed the music video for Cyrus’s song “Wrecking Ball” in 2013. Cyrus later said that she regretted making the video.
