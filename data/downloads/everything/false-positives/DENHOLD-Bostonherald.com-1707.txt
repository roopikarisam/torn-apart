DENVER  — Wilson Chandler sees one thing very clearly through a mask he's wearing to protect his broken nose — the Denver Nuggets need to keep right on winning.


There's still plenty of work to do, but their playoff aspirations are within view.
  


Nikola Jokic scored 30 points, Jamal Murray hit a clutch 3-pointer late — his only one of the game — and the Nuggets held off the Indiana Pacers 107-104 on Tuesday night.


"We can't worry about what other teams are doing," Chandler said. "We have to keep winning, keep playing for one another and doing the right things."
