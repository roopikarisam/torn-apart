BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) â€” Authorities say a man shot and killed another man during a family gathering in Alabama.

Jefferson County Sheriff's Chief Deputy Randy Christian tells AL.com 26-year-old Clifford Montez Hinkle is charged with murder in the Saturday night death of 44-year-old Keith Duncan.

Deputies were called to a reported shooting at a home in the Grayson Valley area and found Duncan suffering from several gunshot wounds. He was pronounced dead at a hospital shortly after 9:30 p.m.


The preliminary investigation shows the victim and suspect had been in an argument. Investigators do not know a motive as Hinkle has not cooperated.

Hinkle was booked into the county jail Sunday afternoon on $100,000 bond.

AL.com did not report whether Hinkle had a lawyer.
