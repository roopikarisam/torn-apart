The senators unveiled a proposal last week to fund key ObamaCare insurer payments and provide states with more flexibility to waive out of ObamaCare rules. 


But, so far, the plan has received a lukewarm reception from Trump and conservative Republicans. 





Trump canceled the payments earlier this month, arguing they were being made illegally, putting the onus on Congress to fund them. 


But some Republicans are wary of looking like they're propping up ObamaCare and see the bill as a bailout for insurers. Others want more concessions from Democrats before they'll vote for the legislation. 


Alexander still needs to win over Trump because Republican leaders likely won't call the bill for a vote without the president's support. A top White House aide says that Trump wants the bill to repeal ObamaCare's mandates and taxes.


If Trump does get on board, it's likely to pass the Senate, where 12 Republicans have already co-sponsored the legislation.

The tougher challenge lies in the House, where conservatives are pushing for more changes.

Meanwhile, funding for the Children's Health Insurance Program expired nearly three weeks ago and Republicans and Democrats in the House haven't made any progress toward a vote.


Energy &amp; Commerce Committee Chairman Greg Walden (R-Ore.) reopened negotiations with Democrats a few weeks ago after the committee passed a bill that only had the support of Republicans. 


The two sides have been trying to come to an agreement on offsets for the program, but are at a deadlock. 


Walden said previously he would move the bill to the floor for a vote next week but has not indicated if that's still the plan.
