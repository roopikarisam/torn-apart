COLUMBUS, Ohio  â€” Ohio prepared on Tuesday to execute a sick inmate who will be provided a wedge-shaped pillow to help him breathe as he's put to death this week.


The U.S. Supreme Court refused to stop the execution of death row prisoner Alva Campbell, who appeared to be out of options.
  


Last week, Republican Gov. John Kasich rejected Campbell's request for clemency. A message was left with the inmate's attorneys seeking comment.
