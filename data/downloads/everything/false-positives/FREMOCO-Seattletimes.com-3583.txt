LA VISTA, Neb. (AP) — The driver of a loaded concrete truck that tipped onto a car near Omaha, killing two people, has been charged with two counts of felony motor vehicle homicide.

 The Omaha World-Herald reports that the 20-year-old Austin Holloway, of Fremont, turned himself in Friday evening and was booked into the Sarpy County Jail.

In filing the charges, the Sarpy County Attorney’s Office says Holloway was driving recklessly and too fast on Oct. 25 in La Vista when the fatal crash occurred.

Investigators say Holloway was driving east on Giles Road in La Vista when he made a sharp right turn. That called the loaded concrete truck to tip and land on a northbound car stopped at a traffic light, killing driver Michael Dearden and passenger Phillip Hertel, both 23.
