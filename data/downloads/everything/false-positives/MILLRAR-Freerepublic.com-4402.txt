WASHINGTON  The SUV driver who struck and killed an infant in a stroller in a Lansdowne, Virginia, crosswalk in August 2016 has been sentenced to one year in jail. 


 The sentence was the maximum John Miller IV, 47, of Leesburg, faced after prosecutors dropped an involuntary manslaughter charge last year. 


 Miller had pleaded no contest in October to a misdemeanor reckless driving charge. 


 Five-month-old Tristan was killed on Aug. 31, 2016, as his mother, Mindy Schulz, pushed his stroller across Riverside Parkway at Coton Manor Drive. Mindy Schulz was severely injured when Millers Jeep Cherokee slammed into the mother and her son, but she has recovered. 


 In handing down his sentence, Loudoun County Circuit Judge Douglas Fleming called the crash a tragic accident but said Miller failed in his responsibility to be attentive while driving. 


 The judge said that one year in jail is not justice or fair. But he said thats all he could do under the law.

In Florida he would have gotten 25 years, minimum..................

On to the civil phase.

This sounds like it really was just a case of poor driving. He’s looking at the vehicle traffic and not looking around enough for pedestrians. Tragic result.

The main drag in my (beach) town is heavy with pedestrian traffic and light on stoplights. Vigilance and low speed required !

I hope so. If the POS is out in 1 year, take away everything he has.

We had a horrible case like that here a few years back.

A young mom was jogging with her twins in a tandem stroller. A 19-year old driver mowed her down at an intersection by running a stop sign. Miraculously the twins survived, but lost their mother.

The kid admitted to having smoked a joint 5 minutes before getting behind the wheel.

My motorcycle rights buddies and I have been trying for several years to get the penalties in Virginia increased for people who kill others through negligent operation of a motor vehicle. Every year we find one or more state delegates and one or more state senators willing to sponsor and introduce bills to add teeth to the current reckless driving laws, and every year our bills get killed in committee.

You forgot the sarcasm tag. In Florida the mother would have been cited for jaywalking. Or illegally crossing a restricted highway. Vehicular fatalities down here are looked upon as "cross-cultural anomalies" with no one found to be at fault or prosecuted.


Your pain is recognized. The Florida legislature and the various county commissions have decriminalized so many violent and irresponsible acts, that virtually every ordinance and statute here is essentially toothless. Thank you, Democrats! At least it gives one a taste of what it would be like living in a banana republic run by the criminals. Guess it’s good practice for what we’re gonna be faced with down the road as a nation. I don’t think a president has sufficient power to reverse any of this.

Not up here in the panhandle. Now, if she was NOT in a crosswalk, that would be a different thing.

We had a recent case where a person was crossing a busy highway in the middle of a block, got hit and the driver was not charged...........
