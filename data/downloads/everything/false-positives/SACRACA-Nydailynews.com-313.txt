The older brother of Stephon Clark, who was fatally shot by cops last month, was arrested in Sacramento, Calif., Thursday.

Stevante Clark, 25, was arrested for allegedly threatening to kill or seriously injure someone as well as calling 911 to annoy or harass, according Sacramento police.

Clark was booked at 12:10 p.m. local time and is ineligible for bail, his Sacramento County jail booking information says.

Sonia Lewis, a family member of Clark, told the Sacramento Bee she didn't know why he was arrested.

She said he should've gotten mental health help instead of being put in jail.

Clark sought mental health treatment after his younger brother Stephon's death, which sparked nationwide protests.

Sacramento police shot the 22-year-old eight times as he stood in his grandmother's backyard on March 18.

Stevante Clark received inpatient mental health treatment at a hospital for two days after police responded to a disturbance call at a local hotel in early April.

"I hate my life," he told CBS Sacramento in a sit-down interview. "What I do know is I'm not crazy. Something is very wrong up there; I can admit that, but I'm not out here doing crazy, stupid belligerent things. I'm trying to take care of my family."

He said he hasn't watched the police bodycam videos showing the fatal confrontation the night his brother died.

"Hearing the gunshots, we haven't seen it, but every time we turn on the TV it's there," he told the station.

Stevante was charged with threats to commit a crime resulting in death or great bodily injury, a felony, and calling 911 with the intent to annoy or harass, which is misdemeanor. In addition, he was charged with assault with a deadly weapon, a felony, and vandalism, a misdemeanor.

His next court appearance is Friday.
