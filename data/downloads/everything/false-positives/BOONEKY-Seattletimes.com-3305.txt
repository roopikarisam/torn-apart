COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) — A Missouri man is now being accused of possessing child pornography after his arrest last month on allegations he was taking photographs of another person in a library bathroom stall.

The Columbia Daily Tribune reports that police arrested 21-year-old Jacob Vanderlinde Thursday on a charge of possession of child pornography.

The Boone County Sheriff’s Department Cyber Crimes Task Force says investigators found evidence of child pornography on Vanderlinde’s phone after his March 12 arrest in the incident at the University of Missouri’s Ellis Library. Vanderlinde is not a student at the university.

The task force says investigators also seized several pieces of evidence while searching Vanderlinde’s home.

Vanderlinde is being held on $50,000 bond. Online jail records don’t list an attorney for him.
