A Huntsville man was booked in the Limestone County Jail after a grand jury indicted him on theft and forgery charges stemming from stealing mail.

 A Huntsville man is behind bars in Limestone County after a grand jury indicted him on multiple charges after authorities say he was stealing mail to duplicate checks. 

 The grand jury charged 39-year-old Tremont DeShawn Heath with first-degree theft, third-degree possession of a forged instrument, third-degree theft and two counts of first-degree identity theft. 

 Investigators say Heath stole one victim's identity in March to make multiple purchases in Athens and Columbia, Tennessee. The purchases totaled just shy of $3,000. When authorities received copies of the checks, they were able to find security video of the person. The video was released to media outlets, and Huntsville investigators recognized Heath. He had warrants for his arrest for similar crimes in Huntsville as well. 

 Limestone County authorities were made aware of similar case in May involving Heath. This time authorities found him on surveillance video making what they say was a fraudulent purchase in Nashville totaling more than $1,300. 

 Heath was already in trouble in Richmond, Virginia, where he was behind bars on different charges. Limestone County deputies traveled there Wednesday to arrest him.
