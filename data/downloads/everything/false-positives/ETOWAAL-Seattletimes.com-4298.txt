RAINBOW CITY, Ala. (AP) — A man who criticized an Alabama sheriff over his spending of taxpayer funds allocated for feeding jail inmates has been charged with marijuana possession and five other offenses.

AL.com reports the Etowah County Sheriff’s Office and Rainbow City police arrested 20-year-old Matthew Qualls on Thursday. AL.com quoted Qualls on Feb. 18 saying Sheriff Todd Entrekin paid him $10 per hour to mow lawns. Qualls said “Sheriff Todd Entrekin Food Provision Account” was printed on checks he received.

Entrekin confirmed he has a “Food Provision” account but declined to say how much is in it or what he uses the money for. Entrekin says he’s not commenting because there’s a lawsuit pending against sheriffs statewide about how the money is used.

Qualls’ attorney, Sam Bone, didn’t respond to AL.com for comment.
