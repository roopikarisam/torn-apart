A Washington County sheriff's corporal was arrested Thursday on suspicion of sexually touching a male colleague without his permission while they both were on duty at the jail.

Kevin J. Kearns, 45, is accused of third-degree sexual abuse and harassment. He was released on his own recognizance and ordered to appear in court Dec. 29, according to Deputy Jeff Talbot, a Sheriff's Office spokesman. 

The co-worker reported the alleged abuse on Dec. 6 and Kearns was placed on paid administrative leave the same day, Talbot said. The co-worker said Kearns initially made sexual comments to him and it escalated to unwanted touching, according to Talbot.

Kearns has been an employee of the county Sheriff's Office since 2006.

The sheriff's office will do an internal investigation in addition to the criminal investigation, Talbot said.
