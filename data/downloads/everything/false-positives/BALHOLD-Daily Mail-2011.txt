Baltimore Ravens rookie first-round pick Marlon Humphrey was arrested and charged with third-degree robbery according to the Tuscaloosa (Ala.) County Sheriff's Office.

The incident was Jan. 13 and the charges listed were suspicion of harassment and stealing a charger listed at $15 in estimated value.

"Marlon told us that it was a misunderstanding regarding a $15 telephone charger, which he thought was his," the Ravens said in a statement. "Our understanding is that he has been interviewed by University of Alabama Police and is cooperating. We are monitoring the situation."

Humphrey, 21, was the 16th pick in the 2017 NFL Draft out of Alabama.

Third-degree robbery is a felony in Alabama. As the 16th overall pick, Humphrey signed a four-year, $11,847,480, more than half of which was paid as a signing bonus.

Humphrey played in every game last season including five starts.
