CALDWELL, Idaho (AP) — Officials are considering spending $11 million for steel trailers to house female inmates at a crowded Idaho detention center.

Canyon County officials are looking at installing temporary inmate housing in the front parking lot of the Dale G. Haile Detention Center in Caldwell, the Idaho Press-Tribune reported .

The idea for the steel trailers was inspired by a facility built for a jail in Greene County, Missouri, in which over 100 inmates are housed in six stainless steel trailers.

A quarter-inch mesh net lined with razor wire surrounds the secure outdoor recreation area between the trailers, Canyon County Sheriff’s Office Capt. Daren Ward said.

Ward on Tuesday presented a draft proposal and design to the Board of Canyon County Commissioners and several other elected officials. The 28 temporary units would house 122 inmates. The “continually rising” female inmate population is the biggest concern for jail staff, Ward said.

“We are over our target population and we are over our maximum bed population of females,” he said.

The jail has 98 female inmates, according to Ward. Thirteen are in a jail annex and 18 are housed outside of the county.

If commissioners decide to lease or purchase the units, Canyon County would close the annex currently housing female inmates for repairs, county spokesman Joe Decker said.

Male inmates would be relocated to the annex after repairs and general maintenance is completed.

Commissioners are scheduling another meeting to discuss logistics and payment plans.
