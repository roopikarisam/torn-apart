NEW YORK, Nov. 15, 2017 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- The Art for Justice Fund, launched earlier this year with a $100 million donation from philanthropist Agnes Gund, today announced the first round of grant recipients in the areas of criminal justice reform and the arts. With awards ranging from $100,000 to $7.5 million, a total of $22 million was awarded to 30 innovative programs that seek to safely reduce prison populations, strengthen education and employment opportunities for formerly incarcerated people, and humanize people affected by the criminal justice system.

The Art for Justice Fund, created by Ms. Gund in partnership with the Ford Foundation and Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors, is a five-year initiative that uniquely connects the ingenuity of criminal justice advocates and the creativity of artists to address the crisis of mass incarceration in America.

"My hope is that the work supported by the Art for Justice Fund will help create a groundswell that drives reforms well beyond these specific programs," said Agnes Gund. "The problem of mass incarceration touches every community across the country, and we need to work together to find creative solutions to build a better, safer future for all our children." 

Key Objectives of the Art for Justice FundThe United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world, with more than 2.2 million people in prisons and detention centers. Low-income people of color are most likely to be arrested and sentenced to prison, and women are the fastest rising sector of the prison population. Mass incarceration deepens poverty by removing wage-earning mothers and fathers from distressed neighborhoods, and leads to devastating outcomes for the children left behind. 

To reverse this harmful trend, the Art for Justice Fund seeks to achieve five key objectives:

"The Art for Justice Fund invests in organizations and artists doing critical work to advance criminal justice reform," said Helena Huang, project director for the Art for Justice Fund. "Over the next five years, we aim to reduce our country's harmful reliance on prisons and jails, and instead to increase community investments in health and public safety."

Among the 30 grants announced today are:

"The funding provided through the Art for Justice Fund to our organization will help us build on our proven grassroots strategies and mobilize even greater numbers of individuals, organizations, and networks to further accelerate the pace of change," said Robert Rooks, vice president at the Alliance for Safety and Justice. 

To date, nearly 30 additional donors have joined Ms. Gund in giving or committing to give additional substantial donations to the Art for Justice Fund. The next round of grant awards is planned for the spring of 2018.
