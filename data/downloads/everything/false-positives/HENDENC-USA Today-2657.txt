Denver Broncos running back De’Angelo Henderson was briefly hospitalized with minor injuries Saturday night after he was involved in an accident during a high-speed police chase involving a woman driving a stolen vehicle.


“I don’t know if lucky is the word,'' Henderson said in an interview with 9News. "Blessed. There’s just so many different words.’’


Rainbow Sunset Espinoza, 37, was arrested and faces 14 charges including stealing a vehicle, driving recklessly, driving while under the influence of alcohol or drugs, evading police and second-degree assault with a deadly weapon, according to the Douglas County Detention Center.


Prosecutors are scheduled to file formal charges on Thursday. However, if Espinoza posts bail, the date moves to June 15.


The stolen vehicle she was driving T-boned Henderson's Jeep, causing it to flip and roll. Henderson's Jeep was struck with such force it flipped over on its top.


"At the last second I saw a truck plow into my passenger side,'' Henderson said. "T-boned, and then everybody who was talking to the police said I was airborne and I flipped in the air and I landed on another car and I rolled after that. I was very fortunate. Very blessed.’’


He was checked out at a hospital and released. He was one of four people hospitalized with injuries from the crash that occurred in Parker, about 25 miles southeast of Denver.


Henderson, the Broncos’ sixth-round draft pick in 2017, was bringing home takeout food for his family when the crash occurred.


He posted an image from the accident on his Instagram account Monday with a caption that reads:


"With OTAs a week a way and a season that I’m competing for a significant roll, the most traumatic event I’ve probably ever had to deal with occurs. T-boned, airborne, flipped, and rolled. I plowed through my jammed door and exit my Jeep on my own. I’m truly blessed that God protected me through this accident. Without his favor I don’t know if I would’ve survived. I’m thankful to only came out with minor injuries and a few scrapes and bruises. Thank you to the Parker Police and South Metro Fire Rescue in Parker for getting to me asap, attending all my needs and transporting me to the hospital safely. Thank you to the doctors at Parker Adventist for treating me as a first class patient also. I’m very grateful and humbled to be alive. My family and I thanks everyone who has prayed for me over the last few days. My thoughts and prayers are with the other victims and I hope they all are safe and doing well. In the mean time I’m rehabbing and getting my body ready to participate in OTAs next week. Thanks everyone again!!! Jeremiah 29:11"

Henderson was at the Broncos’ facility Monday and while he will be held out of the team’s practices this week, he is expected to fully participate in OTAs next week.


“For the most part my body in general is sore,'' Henderson said. "No real injuries. A lot of bruises, a lot of scrapes. But my body is going to get better.’’
