LEXINGTON, Ky. (AP) â€” A police sergeant in Kentucky has been indicted on a charge of first-degree rape.

Lexington police spokeswoman Brenna Angel says in a news release that Sgt. Christopher Morrow was arrested following his indictment Monday by a Fayette County grand jury.

Angel says a complaint was filed against Morrow in May and was forwarded to Kentucky State Police for investigation.

The 39-year-old Morrow is being held in the Fayette County Jail on $10,000 bond. Jail records didn't indicate whether Morrow has an attorney.

Angel says Morrow has been suspended without pay.
