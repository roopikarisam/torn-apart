HITTERDAL, Minn. — Authorities say human remains were discovered during a search on a Minnesota farmstead for a missing person from North Dakota.

Clay County Sheriff's Deputy Stephen Landsem says two people have been detained in the case. The remains have been sent to the Ramsey County Medical Center for identification.

The missing person is identified as 41-year-old Troy Yarbrough, of Wahpeton, North Dakota. He was reported missing on June 9.

Wahpeton Police Chief Scott Thorsteinson says Yarbrough appears to have left his residence of his own volition, but "certain aspects of the case" led police to search a Hitterdal-area residence northeast of Moorhead. It involved a dive team, a drone, and people digging with shovels.

Thorsteinson says charges are expected in the case, but did not give further details.
