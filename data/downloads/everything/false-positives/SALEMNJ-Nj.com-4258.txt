A former Swedesboro Diner employee was arrested after he allegedly started a small fire at the business and tried to get police to kill him, according to a criminal complaint.

Woolwich Township Police responded to the diner around 6:30 p.m. on Dec. 29, where they found Necati Topcu, 62, in the kitchen.

"Mr. Topcu appeared very disturbed, was armed with a kitchen knife, made gestures for officers to kill him and smelled like gasoline," police wrote in the complaint.

After a brief discussion, he was taken into custody without incident, they added.

Investigators found fire damage in a shed attached to the rear of the business, where it appeared someone had started a small fire using gasoline and a stack of diner menus, police said.

Topcu allegedly admitted to a deputy fire marshal on the scene, two employees and his brother that he had come back to his former place of employment to "burn the place down" and "have police kill him."

He was charged with arson and placed in Salem County Correctional Facility.
