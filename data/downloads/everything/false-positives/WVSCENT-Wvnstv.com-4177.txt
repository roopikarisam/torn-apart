KANAWHA COUNTY, WV (WOWK) - Three corrections officers from South Central Regional Jail have been charged with permitting the escape of Todd Boyes on October 25, 2017.


According to criminal complaints, Pam McNeely, Allison Bryant, and Jordon Toler are charged with misdemeanor Permitting Escape.


Boyes was scheduled to have a physical on October 25, but when Toler was sent to get Boyes, he returned with a "Refusal to consent treatment." The document was not signed by Boyes but instead signed by Toler.


Bryant was assigned with watching the pod that Boyes was in prior to his escape. She allegedly failed to make sure that the section door was locked and failed to notify any other jail employee that Boyes had walked out of the section into the main jail hallway.


McNeely said in a recorded statement that she thought Boyes was a counselor coming out of the jaill and let him out without any identification.
