Tipirneni is an emergency-room physician who got support from former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords. She beat Brianna Westbrook, who became involved in politics several years ago as a transgender woman who argued for a Phoenix policy that would protect the LGBTQ community from discrimination.

The Maricopa County Recorder's Office says there have been a few minor hiccups at voting stations in Arizona's 8th Congressional District race in the primary to replace former U.S. Rep. Trent Franks.

Communications director Murphy Hebert said Tuesday that one ballot center in the suburbs west of Phoenix initially lacked the paper ballots needed to cast votes in person. But she says poll workers there still received completed ballots that were mailed to people's homes.

She says that printers didn't initially work at several other voting locations, but the problems were ironed out.

The Arizona Secretary of State's office says about 100,000 early ballots in the 8th Congressional District primary have been counted so far. Officials estimate that another 30,000 ballots will be cast at voting stations before the end of the day.

Press spokesman Matt Roberts says that officials expect as many as 85,000 to 90,000 of the final votes cast will be for one of the dozen Republican candidates vying in the primary to replace U.S. Rep. Trent Franks, who resigned last year. There are two candidates in the Democratic primary for the seat.

Roberts says that the early ballots were mailed out 29 days ago. Of those not already mailed in, many were delivered to polling stations in person.

A Republican candidate for an open U.S. House seat says he made an "honest mistake" when he handed one of his election pamphlets to a voter as he left a polling place.

Phil Lovas says he was walking out after voting Tuesday morning and handed the woman a "palm card." An ABC-15 news crew caught the exchange on video.

It's illegal in Arizona to conduct "electioneering" within 75 feet of a polling place.

Lovas is one of 12 Republicans and two Democrats running in the primary to replace former Rep. Trent Franks.

12:15 a.m.

Sex-related and campaign funding allegations involving several top candidates have captured much of the attention in the Republican primary to replace a U.S. congressman from Arizona who resigned amid charges of sexual misconduct last year.

A former aide to ex-Rep. Trent Franks told The Associated Press he pressed her to carry his child as a surrogate and offered her $5 million.

The top favorites to replace him include former state Sen. Steve Montenegro and former state Sen. Debbie Lesko.

Montenegro is a married father and Christian minister who acknowledged last week that a former Senate aide had sent him texts and an unsolicited topless photo.

Several allegations of illegal campaign funding have been leveled against Lesko, who has denied wrongdoing.

It's unknown how much of an impact any of the allegations will have Tuesday because the state relies heavily on mail-in ballots completed before the revelations surfaced.
