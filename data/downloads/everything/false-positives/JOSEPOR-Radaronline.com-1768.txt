Meghan Markle’s brother Thomas’ fiancée, Darlene Blount, was arrested on New Year’s eve in Oregon after an alleged altercation with the future royal’s brother, and now terrifying audio from the 911 call during the bloody brawl has been released.

Markle’s future sister-in-law can be heard telling the operator Thomas had been threatening her all night, claiming he was being “really f***ing weird” and was beating himself up.


Blount suggested to cops Thomas could be “mentally ill” and claimed she was scared of him as he became drunk and jealous, after thinking she was trying to “f*** some dude” she knew when out at a local bar.

Blount said Thomas was engaging in “mentally abusive type s**t” and added: “I’m more in fear for his own safety right now … really f***ing weird to me. I don’t know what to do.”

Speaking in a timid voice, when asked if Thomas had been drinking too, she said, “Yes, he has.”

“I’m scared, he’s a big guy,” she said.

Once police arrived, they didn’t buy Blount’s story and arrested her after they found Thomas gushing with blood.

As the Daily Mail previously reported, a law enforcement source with the Josephine County Jail said that Thomas’ fiancée “Darlene Blount was booked on January 1st. She was charged with fourth degree assault.”
