A Waukesha County sheriff's deputy was charged Friday with conducting an unauthorized strip search last fall, the sheriff's office said in a news release.


The deputy, a 19-year veteran, is accused of conducting an improper strip search at the county jail after a traffic stop and arrest. After the sheriff's office learned of the incident Nov. 21, it placed the deputy on paid administrative leave and turned the investigation over to the Walworth County Sheriff’s Office.


On Friday, the Walworth County District Attorney’s Office, acting as a special prosecutor, charged the deputy, who was not named in the release.


The Waukesha County Sheriff’s Office is conducting a separate internal investigation.
