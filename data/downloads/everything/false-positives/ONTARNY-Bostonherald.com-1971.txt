A woman, who lost all of her money gambling at the Shorelines Casino Thousand Islands in Gananoque, Ontario, called the police emergency number at 5 in the morning, because she had no way of getting home. But she soon called back to report that a good Samaritan gave her $20, and that she was going back into the casino. They did not hear from her again.
