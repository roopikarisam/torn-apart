Authorities arrested a Clayton man on heroin distribution charges this week.

Officers with the Gloucester County Prosecutor's Office and Clayton Police Department executed a search warrant at the apartment of Nestor A. Cercet, 31, on Tuesday, and seized suspected heroin, materials typically used for packaging narcotics and more than $2,000 in cash, officials said.

Cercet was charged with third-degree possession of a controlled dangerous substance, second-degree distribution of a controlled dangerous substance within 500 feet of a public park and possession of drug paraphernalia.

He was placed in Salem County Correctional Facility pending a detention hearing.

Two others were arrested on outstanding warrants during the raid, according to the prosecutor's office.

Cercet's brother, Desmond M. Catlett, 29, also of Clayton, was arrested on an outstanding Cherry Hill municipal court warrant.

Desiree N. Lutman, 35, of Camden, was arrested on warrants from Moorestown and Seaside Heights municipal courts.
