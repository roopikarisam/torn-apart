 Life in jail is no cake walk â€” and it's even harder when you don't know the unwritten rules. 


 Several law-abiding citizens learned those rules the hard way when they went undercover as inmates for the A&amp;E show "60 Days In." Now in its fourth season, the show followed the undercover participants as they navigated jail life at Clark County Jail in Jeffersonville, Indiana, and Fulton County Jail in Atlanta, for two months. 


 The participants were given false identities and booked under fake charges during their stints behind bars, and needed to maintain their cover stories to prevent other inmates from catching on. 


 As they quickly learned, jail life is governed by strict rules that dictate the way inmates eat, sleep, socialize, and solve disputes. Most people don't know about these complex social dynamics until they experience them for themselves. 


 Read on to find out about the complicated dynamics that take place in jail.
