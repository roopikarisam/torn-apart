MADISON, W.Va. (AP) — At least three people wrote letters in support of a former West Virginia school system employee who was released from jail when a judge changed his sentence for embezzlement.

The Charleston Gazette-Mail reports former Boone County School system employees David Bryan Jarrell and Tracy Lee Harvey were released from jail last week.

Both men were originally sentenced to one to 10 years in prison, but Circuit Judge William Thompson changed their sentences to five years of probation.

Thompson heard apologies from both men at their sentencing hearing last October.

Thompson said during the hearing that Harvey’s apology seemed sincere. But he seemed unsure about Jarrell’s response.

Community members reached out to the judge on behalf of Jarrell. One man said in his letter that Jarrell feels deep remorse for his crime.
