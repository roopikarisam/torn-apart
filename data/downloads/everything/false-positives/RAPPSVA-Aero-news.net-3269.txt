Stafford, VA. Deputies with the Stafford County Sheriff’s Office arrested a suspect on Friday after he severely assaulted his wife, prevented her from calling 911, and then fled the scene on foot.



On April 26, 2018 at approximately 9:46 p.m., Deputy Steven Kellam responded to a call regarding a domestic disturbance in the East Street area of southern Stafford. Upon arrival, the deputy found a woman locked inside a building behind a residence. The woman stated that her intoxicated husband would not leave her alone and she feared for her life. She was sobbing uncontrollably and had severe bruising and swelling to the right eye as well as lacerations all over her face.

The victim told deputies that she tried to call 911 following a heated verbal argument, which prompted her husband, identified as Troy Wayne Rodgers, 54, of Stafford to assault her. Rodgers took the phone out of his wife’s hands, struck her in the face, and then threw her on the ground multiple times. Each time she was thrown on the ground, Rodgers kicked her in the face.

The victim told deputies that Rodgers left the scene following the assault. She then provided a description of the suspect. Deputies successfully tracked the suspect by utilizing the drone team and K-9 Lobo and his handler, Deputy Alex Smith. The drone observed the subject walking along the railroad tracks northwest of the residence and the drone operator was then able to direct the K-9 and handler to the suspect.

Rodgers was incarcerated at Rappahannock Regional Jail without bond. He is charged with domestic assault and battery, prevention of 911, malicious wounding, abduction, and public intoxication.
