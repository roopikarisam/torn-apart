Former Cowboys running back Joseph Randle has been sentenced to five years of probation for charges related to his actions at a 2016 party in Wichita, Kansas.


Randall, who played for the Cowboys from 2013-15, was convicted in April 2017 on charges of aggravated battery, aggravated burglary, criminal threat and marijuana possession. He has already been in jail for more than two years.


According to the Dallas Morning News, Randle got into an argument at a housewarming party in February 2016. When the homeowner asked Randle to leave, he backed into three people with his car. The three suffered minor injuries.


Randle later returned to the party and forced his way into the house.
