Hotel Value for Frequent Guests



								 by  Ric Garrido  1 Comment			


Ten major hotel chains with loyalty programs currently number 134 different hotel brands for earning and redeeming points. Over 25% of these brands became part of their respective hotel loyalty program within the past six years.

I have followed these loyalty programs for more than a decade and some of the hotel brands listed in different major chains, as seen in the company’s brand profile logos, are new names to me. 

There is value in simply observing how each hotel chain self-positions its brands. 

Smith Travel Research provides a hotel industry standard market segment ranking for most of the major chain brands based on average room rates from Luxury – Upper Upscale – Upscale – Upper Midscale – Midscale – Economy.
