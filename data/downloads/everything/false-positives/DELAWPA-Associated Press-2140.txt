MUNCIE, Ind. (AP) â€” An inmate at a central Indiana jail is suing over conditions at the overcrowded lockup, alleging that they violate his constitutional rights.

Steven Charles Schick's hand-written civil lawsuit was filed Tuesday and names the Delaware County Jail as the sole defendant.


The Star Press reports Schick's suit alleges that "unsafe and unhumanlike living conditions" at the jail are violating his constitutional rights.


The 41-year-old Muncie man who's awaiting trial on drug-dealing charges contends that inmates assigned to sleeping pods in the jail's common areas have recently stolen commissary food from other inmates and bullied them.

Schick's suit says jail guards are "not properly doing their jobs and securing inmates."

Sheriff Ray Dudley says inmates not assigned to cells in the jail are monitored throughout the day by corrections officers.
