OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) â€” A Tulsa dentist accused in the death of the 19-month-old son of a woman he was in a relationship with has been charged with conspiracy to have the woman killed.

Oklahoma County District Court records indicate 36-year-old Bert Glen Franklin was charged Monday with conspiracy to commit first-degree murder.

Franklin was scheduled to go to trial for first-degree murder Monday in the death of Lincoln Von Henry Lewis. Prosecutors allege Franklin caused fatal injuries to the child's head in July 2016 at the home of the child's mother, Roxanne Lewis Randall. Lincoln died two days later. Franklin has pleaded not guilty to the murder charge.

The trial was postponed after prosecutors accused Franklin of soliciting the help of fellow jail inmates to kill Randall, a witness in the murder case.
