NORTH PLATTE, Neb. (AP) — The Nebraska State Patrol says troopers have seized 47 pounds of marijuana products — including 38 pounds of edible marijuana products — in a traffic stop near North Platte.

The patrol says troopers stopped an eastbound car Monday afternoon on Interstate 80.

After speaking with occupants, troopers reported a strong smell of marijuana coming from the car. Troopers say a search of the car turned up the edibles, three pounds of hash oil butter and 31 grams of marijuana.

The car’s three occupants, all from Connecticut, were arrested on suspicion of possession with intent to distribute. The three, ranging in age from 21 to 24, were booked into the Lincoln County Jail.
