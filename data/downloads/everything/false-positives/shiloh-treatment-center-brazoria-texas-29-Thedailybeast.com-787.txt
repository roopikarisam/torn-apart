Immigrant children being held in detention centers were forcibly given psychiatric drugs, a lawsuit alleges. Officials at the Shiloh Treatment Center, near Houston, Texas, told children the drugs were vitamins and said they had to take them in order to see their parents again, according to the suit. It alleges the drugs made children “dizzy, listless, obese and even incapacitated,” Reveal reports. After they were given the drugs, children became tired and unable to walk, they told lawyers, according to court documents. “Two staff grabbed me, and the doctor gave me the injection despite my objection and left me there on the bed,” one girl said. She also alleged a supervisor at the center threw her into a door and choked her until she lost consciousness. The federal suit was filed in April. The federal government pays the Shiloh Treatment Center to house unaccompanied immigrant minors.
