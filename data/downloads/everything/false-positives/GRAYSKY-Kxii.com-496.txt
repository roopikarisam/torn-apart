VAN ALSTYNE, Tex. (KXII) -  A Van Alstyne man is in jail after he barricaded himself in his apartment unit for around six hours Saturday night. 

The standoff began around 9:45 p.m. Saturday with a call of shots fired and a report of a disturbance at the Hackberry Park Apartments on Henry Hynds Expressway in Van Alstyne. 

Neighbors said they heard people yelling and were ordered to go inside once police arrived. Police said an armed man, later identified as Lee Mason, had barricaded himself inside his apartment unit. 

"It all went downhill from there," said neighbor Taylor Long. "Cops started showing up everywhere."

Van Alstyne police called in multiple other departments, the Sherman and Denison Negotiators, and finally, the Sherman SWAT team. 

They were then able to obtain an arrest and search warrant before throwing tear gas in his apartment to get him to come out. 

"It was a little terrifying," Long said. 

The tear gas finally made Mason emerge after six hours. He was arrested for deadly conduct and booked into the Grayson County Jail.

Police said they're thankful he finally came out and that nobody was hurt. They're unsure of a motive at this time.
