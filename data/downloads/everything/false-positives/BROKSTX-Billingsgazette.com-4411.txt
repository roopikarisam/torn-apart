The new women’s wing at the Yellowstone County Detention Facility will soon be put to use, easing crowding and resolving longstanding complaints that conditions for female inmates were not on par with men’s.

Within the month, jail staff will move men into the new, 148-bed women’s wing while contractors begin plumbing, electrical and paint work on the men’s units. After that is complete, the women will move to their new wing.

The entire process should conclude within the next few months, although Sheriff Mike Linder declined to provide an exact timeline, citing security concerns.

The expansion project came about after years of increasing crowding at the jail and concerns that the women’s space lacked the recreation opportunities and certain safety controls that men had.

The old women’s unit, built to accommodate 38 people, regularly holds a population in the 90s, Linder said. Women have been sleeping on cots set up in the common area, partitioned off with privacy screens.

Current county estimates show the expansion project will finish roughly $500,000 under the projected $16.9 million cost.

Of that, $9.7 million was borrowed, after voters approved the request, and the remainder came from the sheriff’s and county’s capital improvement funds.

The county will spend another $3.5 million rehabbing the men’s units, Finance Director Kevan Bryan said.

The new women's units are designated for maximum, medium and minimum security — a feature that the old women’s facility lacks. The units are also monitored from a separate, elevated control room in the center of the wing.

Linder said the change makes both inmates and jail employees safer.

In addition, the new women's units have access to the outdoor recreation yard and tables with chess boards painted on.

Once women move into the new wing, the old women’s facility will be used for male inmates with special medical or mental health needs, Undersheriff Sam Bofto said.

The project was designed by Schutz Foss Architecture. Swank Enterprises Inc. served as the general contractor.
