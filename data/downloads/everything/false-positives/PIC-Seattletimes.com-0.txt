PORT ISABEL, Texas (AP) — A 165-year-old lighthouse in South Texas has reopened after months of renovations.

An official with the Texas Parks &amp; Wildlife Department says the Port Isabel Lighthouse reopened Tuesday. Spokesman Steve Lightfoot says the lighthouse had been closed since October 2016 for $630,000 in updates.

The Port Isabel structure, according to the agency’s website, is one of 16 lighthouses originally constructed along the Texas coast but is the only one open to the public.

Port Isabel is at one end of the highway bridge connecting to South Padre Island. The lighthouse was built in 1853 and features 75 winding stairs leading to an expansive view of beaches.

Department officials say the Port Isabel Lighthouse has been a favorite for couples to exchange wedding vows atop the tower.
