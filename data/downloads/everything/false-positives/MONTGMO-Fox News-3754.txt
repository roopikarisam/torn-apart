An Alabama inmate with a “ride or die” tattoo has escaped custody for the second time in less than a month, this time taking off on an electric dirt bike, authorities believe.

Shane Anthony Vernon, who was being held at the Coosa County Jail outside of Montgomery on felony charges, made his getaway Sunday afternoon.

"Vernon physically circumvented the security of the jail and escaped the facility,'' Coosa County Sheriff Terry Wilson told The Birmingham News.

Police said they believe the 27-year-old stole an electric dirt bike and he was last seen in a wooded area of nearby Elmore County.

Wilson told the newspaper Vernon is considered armed and extremely dangerous and has numerous tattoos, including one of a Chinese symbol on his neck.

The 27-year-old last escaped on Oct. 29 by forcibly removing his restraints while being processed into the jail, The Birmingham News reported. He lasted one night before being captured the next morning.

Police are asking anyone with information on Vernon’s whereabouts to call the sheriff’s office at 256-377-2211.
