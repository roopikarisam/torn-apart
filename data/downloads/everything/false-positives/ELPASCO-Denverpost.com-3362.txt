Colorado Springs police arrested a man Saturday who had fled a traffic stop after finding him in the trunk of his vehicle.

An officer who responded to a report that a suspicious vehicle was in the 700 block of Castle Road, noticed that the car was one she had tried to stop Thursday, according to a police release. “Upon initial contact with the vehicle, officers observed the suspect, Kyle Becker climb out of the trunk, but quickly go back into the trunk when he observed officers by his vehicle.”

Becker eventually came out of the trunk and fled on foot. A police dog named Maverick ran him down, and he was taken to a hospital before being booked into the El Paso jail for felony eluding and obstructing a peace officer.
