ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) — Authorities say a suspect in a 2016 double murder is back in custody after being accidentally released from an Albuquerque jail.

Metropolitan Detention Center officials say there was a mix-up Monday and Angel Celis’ paperwork didn’t include the no-bond hold in the homicide cases.

He was freed for about three hours until jail officials realized the mistake, issued an arrest warrant and the 22-year-old Celis was found at a hotel.

KRQE-TV reports Celis could face additional charges after police say they found guns and drugs in his hotel room.

Celis is accused in the fatal shootings of two women on the same day in January 2016.

Authorities say Celis allegedly was possession of a gun that evidence ties to both shootings.

It’s still undetermined if he’s competent to stand trial.
