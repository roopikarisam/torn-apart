DELAWARE — A Delaware police officer, charged last year with his second driving under the influence violation in just over 10 years, was sentenced Friday morning to a minor misdemeanor.


Jared T. Wood, 34, who was hired in 2013, pleaded guilty to one count of reckless operation and fined $100 and court costs by retired Greene County Judge J. Timothy Campbell.


Wood was stopped for swerving out of his lane on Sept. 21 in downtown Delaware, said attorney Brad Tammaro, special prosecutor in the case from the Ohio Attorney General's office. A State Highway Patrol trooper smelled a strong odor of alcohol. Wood refused both breath and field sobriety tests.


In accepting the plea agreement, Campbell noted that Wood had completed a three-day alcohol assessment and treatment program. He also served two weekends in jail.


Wood's first DUI was in July 2007, for which he was sentenced to one year of community control.


Had the second offense fallen within 10 years of his most-recent, he could have faced up to six months in jail.


Delaware Police Chief Bruce Pijanowski said he was disappointed in Wood, who has been on unpaid leave for six months.


"We take this seriously, Pijanowski said. "There will be discipline and it will rise to the level of what he did."
