A new Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) office on the front lines of the opioid crisis will aim to tackle exploding drug overdose death rates and Mexican drug trafficking, according to its chief-in-waiting, DEA agent D. Christopher Evans. 


Evans, who currently serves as Associate Special Agent in Charge of the Detroit field office, will move up to the role of Special Agent in Charge of the DEA's new Louisville division. That office, which was announced earlier this month, will be the 22nd field office in the DEA's network. It will combine DEA operations in the states of Kentucky, West Virginia, and Tennessee, all of which were previously under the auspices of other field offices. 


Evans, a 25-year veteran of the DEA, joined the Detroit field officewhich previously oversaw DEA operations in Kentuckyin September. Prior to that, he spent much of his career in Los Angeles, working as an agent and a supervisor and dealing with the drug war on the border. He also did stints at DEA headquarters, at the Mexico/Central America desk, and working for the head of the agency. 


Evans's work in Louisville and the Detroit field office has presented markedly different challenges from those he faced working on the border, he told the Free Beacon. On the border, he explained, he "would have been looking more at direct contact with the sources, and trying to stem the flow as it comes into the country."

Idiots. He should have been moved to McDowell County, WV.

Louisville is in crisis along with Indiana.

Way isn’t someone asking the real questions about how this drug epidemic got out of control under the Obama Admin?

Maybe giving everyone on Medicaid and Medicare opiods instead of treating the underlying medical problems had something to do with this?

I know for a fact several people who had bonefide medical conditions which would have been fixed surgically given pain meds to manage the problem.

Cheap fix in the beginning is a nightmare of huge cost now.

You may well be right that Welch would be the epicenter.

A rattling bottle of Loritab is the newest and most effective mating call in Appalachia.

This has been bad long before Obama was there.

“Maybe giving everyone on Medicaid and Medicare opiods instead of treating the underlying medical problems had something to do with this?”

Obamacare....take a pill.
