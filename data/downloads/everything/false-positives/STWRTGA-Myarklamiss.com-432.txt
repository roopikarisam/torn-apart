UNION PARISH, La. - A Union Parish resident has been booked into the parish detention center for fighting with this brother because “the mules had gotten out their pen.”


Twenty-five-year old Dakota Jared Redden of Farmerville, was booked for simple battery (domestic) and a felony count of aggravated assault with a firearm. His total bond was set at $9,250, according to Sheriff Dusty Gates.


Gates said deputies were dispatched in the early morning hours Thursday to the 800 block of Stewart Road. The victim, his girlfriend and their child were sleeping when the suspect came into their bedroom yelling about the mules escaping.


Deputies reported that the brothers went outside, argued for a while and then the brother went back inside and locked the door. The brother stated that Redden then kicked the door in and that he hit Redden in the face as he came into the house.


The brother was struck in the face several times and was bleeding when deputies arrived. During the fight, the brother and his girlfriend both reported that Redden pulled out a black handgun and threatened his brother with it.


Redden denied threatening his brother with the gun.
