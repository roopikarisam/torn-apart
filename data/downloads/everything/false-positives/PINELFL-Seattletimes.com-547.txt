ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. (AP) — The attorney for a former Tampa Bay and University of Alabama defensive end arrested in Florida on drug charges says the public should withhold judgment until a proper investigation is complete.

Andrew Mallory, representing 50-year-old Keith McCants, said in a statement Tuesday that innocent people are too often tried and convicted in the court of public opinion based on limited or inaccurate information.

Pinellas County Jail records show McCants was arrested early Monday near St. Petersburg. He’s charged with a felony count of possession of crack cocaine and driving with a revoked or suspended license.

McCants made the All-America Team at Alabama and was selected fourth overall by the Buccaneers in the 1990 NFL Draft. His career ended in 1995. He also played for the Oilers and Cardinals.
