ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — University at Albany students are helping local jail inmates connect with their children.

Albany County Jail inmates participating in the program are recorded while reading a children’s book. A CD of the reading is mailed with the book to the child’s home.

The goal of the program run from Albany’s School of Criminal Justice is to lessen the emotional burden children feel when a parent is behind bars.

Recordings began this month at the Albany jail.
