The Kenosha County (Wis.) district attorney is considering charges against a man accused of killing two brothers after a fight at a bar in Twin Lakes, just across the Illinois border.


Kenneth Samuel III, 31, and his 28-year-old brother, Richard Samuel, were fatally shot about 2 a.m. Friday when a fight inside the Beach Bar spilled out into the parking lot.


Witnesses said the two victims and suspect had been fighting before the shooting.


Twin Lakes police Capt. Dennis Linn said the suspect being held in the Kenosha County Jail could be charged Monday. Linn said the village of 4,700 people has not had an intentional homicide case since the 1980s.


Several people at the Beach Bar, which overlooks Lake Mary, told the Kenosha News that the Samuel brothers were regulars at the establishment and were well-liked in the community.


The suspect fled the scene and was later arrested in Monroe County.
