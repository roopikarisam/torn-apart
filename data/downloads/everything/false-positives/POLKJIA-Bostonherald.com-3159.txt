LAKELAND, Fla. — A 53-year-old woman riding a horse down a busy Florida highway has been arrested and charged with driving drunk.


Polk County Sheriff's officials said in a news release that someone called 911 about a woman who appeared confused and possibly in danger. When deputies arrived they found Donna Byrne riding her horse in the road.
  


Officers did a sobriety test and said she gave breath samples that registered blood-alcohol level of .161 — twice Florida's legal limit of .08.
