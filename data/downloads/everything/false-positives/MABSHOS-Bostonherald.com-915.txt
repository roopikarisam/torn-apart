BOSTON â€” Three former guards at a Massachusetts facility that treats the mentally ill in the state criminal justice system have been acquitted of charges in the 2009 death of an inmate with schizophrenia.


Inmate Joshua Messier suffered heart failure when the guards forcefully strapped him to a bed.
  


The Boston Globe reports a judge said Monday that the defendants' "conduct" did not constitute wanton and reckless disregard for the 23-year-old Messier's life.
