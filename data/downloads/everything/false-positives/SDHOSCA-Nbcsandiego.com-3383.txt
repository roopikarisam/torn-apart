He was located a quarter of a mile east of the Round Up Grill on SR-76. 


The 2-year-old white male is not named Noe, according to Lt. Matthew Glisson with the San Diego County Sheriff's Department.


The child was described as having black hair and wearing a yellow shirt and green shorts. 


Glisson had no details on the child's condition. He said the boy appears to have walked away from home. The toddler was released into the custody of his mother, Glisson said.
