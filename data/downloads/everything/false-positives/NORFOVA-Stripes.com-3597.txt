	NORFOLK, Va. (Tribune News Service) — Two brothers have been charged with murder in the shooting death of a Navy sailor more than two years ago, Norfolk police and prosecutors said Thursday.


	The killing of Christopher Allen, 27, came during one of the deadliest years in the city’s past decade.


	On Jan. 4, 2016, police got a report of gunfire in the 2600 block of Waverly Way shortly before 11 p.m. Officers found Allen suffering from a gunshot wound. He later died at Sentara Norfolk General Hospital.


	Police identified the two suspects as Raymond Martin, 34, of the 800 block of E. 27th Street, and Tremaine Martin, 37, of the 2300 block of Waverly Way.


	A grand jury indicted them Wednesday on charges of second-degree murder, malicious wounding and related gun crimes, including possession of a firearm by a convicted felon. Police arrested Tremaine Martin after the indictment, and his brother was already in jail on another case.


	Both are being held in the Norfolk City Jail without bond.


	The two are brothers, said Amanda Howie, a spokeswoman for the Norfolk commonwealth’s attorney.


	In a news release, police did not mention a possible motive for the shooting.


	Howie said another man was injured in the attack.


	Allen joined the Navy straight out of high school even though he’d won a full scholarship from Southern University in Baton Rouge, The Pilot reported in 2016.


	He had plans to re-enlist for another 10 years and was studying to get a promotion to chief petty officer.
