Barry DeWayne Massey, 51, of Seth is charged with attempted grand larceny, grand larceny of a vehicle and fleeing in a vehicle after he is accused of stealing an ambulance and leading police on a pursuit last Wednesday, police said. 





The ambulance was taken from Brooks Street.


Wayne Harmon, director of operations for Kanawha County Ambulances said the ambulance was idling on the lot near Charleston General Hospital when an employee realized someone was driving it off the lot. The crew was in the office at the time.


All of the ambulances have GPS tracking and a police pursuit started nearby on Slack Street, according to police. 





The chase ended about 7:40 a.m. in a remote area off of Mill Creek Road.


There were no ambulance personnel or patients inside the vehicle when it was stolen, Metro 911 said.


The stolen ambulance did not appear to have any serious damage and is back in service.


Massey was taken to the hospital after he was taken into custody. He was released Sunday and taken to the South Central Regional Jail.
