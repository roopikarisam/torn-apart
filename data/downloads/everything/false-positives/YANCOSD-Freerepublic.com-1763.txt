In the "What Did He Expect?" category, a deputy sheriff who defeated his boss for election was fired one minute after the polls closed. That means Sheriff-elect Mark Maggs of Bon Homme County, South Dakota, is out of a job until he takes office in January, when incumbent Lenny Gramkow's term expires, the Yankton Daily Press &amp; Dakotan reports.


Maggs was Gramkow's only challenger in the Republican primary on Tuesday (June 5). With no other candidates seeking the job, the GOP winner would become the sheriff for a four-year term. Maggs defeated Gramkow by a margin of almost 3 to 1.

Sore loser.................

Hmmm, unlawful termination case perhaps?

Wish they could pull that off in Broward county.

No. I believe command level deputies and maybe all deputies serve at the pleasure of the Sheriff and can be hired or fired at will.

From what I’ve heard, it’s not unusual for new Sheriff’s to appoint their own command staff when they take office.

I would think the incoming Sheriff would have expected this and been prepared.

The sheriff is an idiot since the new sheriff could go after him once in office. That sheriff is probably a crook and could easily find himself in jail.

sounds rigged...

Could be a federal civil rights issue here. Fired for expressing a political opinion?

wrongful termination suit should suffice.

Then the new Sheriff has the right to fire employees when he takes office
too.

That’s funny.

The outgoing sheriff sounds like a vindictive b*tch.

Sore loser

Obviously something is going on down there giving the sitting sheriff lost to this guy by 3 to 1 in the primary....

Under state law, a sheriff holds broad authority in the hiring and firing of
his personnel. In addition, South Dakota is a right to work state where
employees can be fired without cause.

shows the people were right in electing the deputy. The current sheriff is not a decent person and has problems that, to me, suggest he should no longer hold that office anyway.

the article says Bon Homme County is in South Dakota?
Is that correct?

Yes. I put it in the keywords

Could be worse, listen to Eric Clapton s song. I shot the sheriff.

That is correct. Per the Wikipedia citation below, it’s in southeastern South Dakota - right along the Nebraska border.

When you think of how to pronounce the county name, think Bonham - as in John Bonham, former member of Led Zeppelin.
