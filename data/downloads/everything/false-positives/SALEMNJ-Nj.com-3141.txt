A Monroe Township man sought by authorities after he skipped a November court appearance on drug charges was arrested Wednesday on drug distribution, weapons and child endangerment charges.

Officers from the Gloucester County Prosecutor's Office tracked Takeem R. Gray, 37, to a home on Lakeside Drive in Williamstown.

When he failed to respond to officers' commands, they entered the home and found Gray trying to dispose of narcotics, according to the prosecutor's office.

Officers recovered marijuana, crack cocaine, a loaded .40 caliber handgun and drug paraphernalia.

Three children were in the home at the time of the arrest, officials said. A woman in the home, Christian Paynter, 30, of Monroe Township, was charged with endangering and released on a warrant.

The children are now in the custody of a relative, authorities said.

Gray was placed in Salem County Correctional Facility pending a detention hearing.
