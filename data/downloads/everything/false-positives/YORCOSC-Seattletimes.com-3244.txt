ROCK HILL, S.C. (AP) — Authorities say a South Carolina man who burned down his roommate’s mobile home and attempted to make an insurance claim has been arrested.

The Herald of Rock Hill reported Wednesday that 57-year-old James Harold Baldwin was charged with second-degree arson and burning personal property to defraud an insurer. Firefighters later told police that no one was inside the mobile home at the time of the June 6 fire.

York County Sheriff’s Office spokesman Trent Faris says Baldwin is accused of burning down the mobile home while his roommate was out of town. Authorities say he then tried to make an insurance claim on his possessions.

Baldwin is being held at the York County Detention Center on a $20,000 bond. It’s unclear if he has a lawyer.
