SECAUCUS -- A 22-year-old man was arrested last week after he tried stealing hundreds of dollars in merchandise off a truck at a local Macy's warehouse, authorities said. 

Isaiah T. Caston of Jersey City was charged with theft after police were called to the Macy's Logistics and Operations warehouse on Meadowlands Parkway on Feb. 14 on the report of an employee theft, Secaucus police Capt. Dennis Miller said. 

A loss prevention officer at the facility told police that Caston was concealing various items, including shirts, wallets and perfume, as he was loading or unloading a truck, Miller said. 

Authorities determined he was attempting to steal $475 worth of merchandise, Miller said. 

Police also learned that Caston was wanted on a Somerset County warrant for drug distribution charges, as well as a warrant out of Jersey City for aggravated assault, Miller added. 

Caston was served his complaint warrant and was transported to the Hudson County jail in Kearny.
