“We're all about 20. We're all kids, we're ready to go out and have fun. We're all 22, 23. ... It's going to be dope." Anderson, 24, said he wants to "step into that leader role" for the group. "Lead by example.”

“That's a little cocky, I don't mean it like that. It came from the comic books. Going off the Marvel stuff, it's a core group of guys. By no means am I saying everyone's going to be a ‘legend of tomorrow.’ but there's a big group of us, everyone has their specialty, everyone has their niche. … Just like in a super group, everyone has their thing that they're known for, that they excel at. It's our jobs right now to push ourselves, push one another, to get that level where the idea of even being a so-called 'legend' is even a question.”

Not that long ago, Cubs fans referred to the players who carried the franchise’s future as the “Core Four.”  Meanwhile, 76ers fans endured season after miserable season while being asked to “trust the process” — and now All-Star Joel Embiid calls himself “The Process.”

The White Sox are undergoing their own youth movement, and we recently asked some of their rising players to come up with a moniker that best fits their group.
