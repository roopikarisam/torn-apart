A baboon escaped from a crate at the San Antonio International Airport Monday afternoon, airport officials confirmed.


The primate was on board American Airlines flight 1014 from Chicago. While moving the crate from the plane's cargo hold and to the baggage area, the baboon got loose.


Viewer video captured the monkey moving from the American Airlines facilities and towards the United Airlines baggage area, where it was able to evade authorities for almost an hour.

San Antonio Police say that the monkey was contained around 3:45 PM. Crews were able to isolate the monkey to a room at the airport. Most operations at San Antonio International have returned to normal, though the airport has announced that some flights may be delayed due to the "wildlife issue."
