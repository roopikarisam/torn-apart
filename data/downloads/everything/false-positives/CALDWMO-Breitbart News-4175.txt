Pope is serving a 25-day sentence at the Seal Beach Police Department Detention Center in Orange County, California. However, under the terms of a work-release program, Pope is allowed to leave to go to Lakers practices and games, so long as they’re in the state of California. He must also wear a GPS monitor when he’s outside the facility.


The 25-day sentence stems from a probation violation, that traces back to an incident in March, when Pope was with the Pistons.

According to ESPN, “…while Caldwell-Pope was a member of the Detroit Pistons. He was cited for operating a vehicle while intoxicated but pleaded guilty in May to the lesser charge of allowing someone to operate his vehicle while under the influence, which carried a 12-month probation.

“The Times reported that Caldwell-Pope failed to comply with an order that required him to submit to mandatory alcohol and drug testing as part of the probation, resulting in the violation.”

As for the conditions Pope is dealing with while in detention, “The Seal Beach facility charges $120 per night to inmates in the work-release program. Inmates in the pay-to-stay program are allowed to have new beds, flat-screen televisions and media centers, but are behind bars and may not watch TV after lights out, which starts at 10 p.m.”

Pope has missed two road games due to the detention, he will also miss two upcoming road games against Houston and Minnesota.

Pope is in his first year with the Lakers, he signed a one-year $18 million deal with Los Angeles in July.
