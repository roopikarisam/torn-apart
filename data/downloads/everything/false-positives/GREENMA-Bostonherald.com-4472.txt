LUCASVILLE, Ohio  â€” Ohio called off the execution of an ailing 69-year-old killer Wednesday after the executioners couldn't find a vein to insert the IV that delivers the lethal drugs.


It was only the third time in modern U.S. history that an execution attempt was halted after the process had begun.
  


Alva Campbell, condemned to die for killing a teenager during a carjacking two decades ago, was promptly given a new execution date by Republican Gov. John Kasich that is a year and a half away.
