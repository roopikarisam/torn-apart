Law enforcement authorities in eastern New Mexico say an officer helped three inmates escape from a county lockup

CLOVIS, N.M. (AP) — Law enforcement authorities in eastern New Mexico say an officer helped three inmates escape from a county lockup.

Curry County Sheriff Wesley Waller says detention officer Sarina Dodson was arrested Saturday in Texas on a felony charge of assisting escape.

Waller says Dodson was working when three inmates escaped from the detention center in Clovis Friday.

The inmates were identified as Aaron Clark, who was accused of attempted child abuse and identity fraud; Ricky Sena, who was facing charges of aggravated battery with a deadly weapon and auto theft; and Victor Apodaca, who had been jailed on drug charges.

Dodson is at the Lubbock County jail. Records do not list an attorney.

The Eastern New Mexico News reports the jail has had multiple escapes, including eight one night in 2008.
