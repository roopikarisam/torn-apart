This undated Nevada Department of Corrections photo shows death row inmate Scott Raymond Dozier, who was convicted in 2007 of robbing, killing and dismembering a 22-year-old man in Las Vegas, and was convicted in Arizona in 2005 of another murder and dismemberment near Phoenix. Dozier is slated to die Wednesday, July 11, 2018, by a three-drug lethal injection combination never before tried in any state and has said repeatedly he wants his sentence carried out and he doesn't care if it's painful.
