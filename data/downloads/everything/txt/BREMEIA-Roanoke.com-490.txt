MOLALLA, Ore. (AP) â€” Authorities say a man was charged with manslaughter, drunken driving and other crimes after a single-vehicle crash that killed a young passenger near Molalla, Oregon.


The Clackamas County Sheriff's Office said Monday that 34-year-old Shane Bremer of Hubbard was driving a Chevrolet Tahoe that crashed Friday in a rural part of the county. Also in the car were Bremer's girlfriend and her three kids.


One of the children, 6-year-old Derick Bedwell, died in the wreck. The girlfriend was flown to a hospital for treatment of injuries and her two other children were taken by ambulance.


Bremer was booked into the Clackamas County Jail.
