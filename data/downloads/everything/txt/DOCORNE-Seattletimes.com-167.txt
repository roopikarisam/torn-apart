LAS VEGAS (AP) — Nevada prison officials say the death of a 50-year-old inmate at a halfway house in Las Vegas is being investigated as an apparent suicide.

The Nevada Department of Corrections said Friday that Rodney Thomas James was found about 3 a.m. Thursday in his room at the Casa Grande Transitional Housing Facility.

Officials say James was housed alone at the time, and had a bed sheet tied around his neck attached to an upper bunk. He was pronounced dead a short time later.
