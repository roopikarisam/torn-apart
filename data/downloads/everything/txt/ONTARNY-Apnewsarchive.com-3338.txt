RIFLE, Colo. (AP) â€” The main suspect of a March homicide in Rifle has been arrested in Ontario, Oregon.

The Post Independent reports (http://bit.ly/2fxVGtN ) that Michael Francis Montgomery was arrested on Monday in connection to the killing of his son-in-law Christopher Gallegos. An arrest warrant for Montgomery was issued in March.

Gallegos died from a gunshot wound to the head outside an apartment building. The shooting is the only homicide in Garfield County this year.

A man who answered the phone at the Malheur County jail in Oregon said Montgomery is awaiting extradition and has not yet hired an attorney.
