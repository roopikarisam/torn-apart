COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa (AP) — Prosecutors say a federal prison has been sentenced to more jail time for being found with synthetic marijuana while behind bars.

Official say 32-year-old Ivan Antonio Cervantes was sentenced Wednesday to 18 additional months in prison and two years of supervised release.

The sentenced is to be served after his current 70-month sentence for another felony drug offense.

Prosecutors say Cervantes and others distributed the synthetic marijuana while imprisoned at the Pottawattamie County Jail in Council Bluffs. Jail staff seized the drug from Cervantes’ cell with the use of a drug-sniffing dog on May 17.

Further investigation revealed another individual brought the substance to the jail, and then distributed the substance to other inmates.
