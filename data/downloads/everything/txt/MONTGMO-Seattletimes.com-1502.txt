MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) — An Alabama man has been arrested in the stabbing death of his 22-year-old son.

News outlets report that Montgomery police responding to a report of a shooting early Friday morning found Ladarius Snow stabbed and arrested 47-year-old Darius Richardson at the scene. Snow was transported to Jackson Hospital, where he was later pronounced dead.

Richardson was charged with murder Saturday after he was released from a local hospital for an unrelated medical issue. Montgomery County Detention Facility records show he’s being held at the jail on a $150,000 bond. It’s unclear if he has a lawyer.

Police say the stabbing stemmed from an argument. Further details have not been released.
