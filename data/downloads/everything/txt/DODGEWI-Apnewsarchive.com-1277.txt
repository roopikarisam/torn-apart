JUNEAU, Wis. (AP) â€” Sheriff's deputies say an inmate who escaped from the Dodge County Jail is now back in custody.

Authorities say 30-year-old Dylan Farber was arrested Friday by the Wauwatosa Police Department and was being returned to Dodge County.

The Dodge County Sheriff's Office said that Farber escaped from the jail in Juneau at about 2 a.m. Friday and likely stole a GM Suburban. He was being held for fleeing law enforcement. It's expected that he'll face more charges now, including escape.

Farber also has charges pending in Dane and Green Lake counties.

The sheriff's office says it will conduct an investigation to ensure a similar incident doesn't happen again.
