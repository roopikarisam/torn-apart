After decades of slinging pints and sausages to Lincoln Square residents, Chicago Brauhaus is shuttering in December, Eater Chicago reports. The announcement comes nearly eight months after rumors surfaced (and were rebuffed) of the beer hall’s imminent closing. Chicago Brauhaus has provided more than five decades of traditional Bavarian fare, dance music and lederhosen off the Western Brown Line. 

According to a commenter on LTH Forum (posted on Monday), the following note was left on tables for Brauhaus patrons: 

What 2016 was for celebrities, 2017 has been for beloved Chicago bars and restaurants. The beer hall joins a long list of spots that surprisingly (and often abruptly) closed permanently this year. Luckily, you’ve still got a few more weeks to get your oompah on before Chicago Brauhaus closes its doors for good on December 11.
