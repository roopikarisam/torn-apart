Cameron County jail records show that a Schlitterbahn executive has been arrested here on a murder warrant out of Kansas.

Authorities arrested Jeffrey Wayne Henry on Monday.

Last Friday, a grand jury in Kansas City, Kan. indicted Schlitterbahn director of operations Tyler Austin Miles on charges of involuntary manslaughter, aggravated endangerment of a child and aggravated battery, the Kansas City Star reports.

The Kansas Attorney General has been investigating the Aug. 7, 2016, decapitation of 10-year-old Caleb Schwab on a water slide in a Kansas City, Kan., Schlitterbahn water park, the newspaper reports.

Caleb Schwab was the son of Kansas state Rep. Scott Schwab, numerous media outlets have reported.

Henry, who the Kansas City Star identifies as the co-owner of Schlitterbahn, faces one count of murder, 12 counts of aggravated battery and five counts of endangering a child, Cameron County jail records show.

Caleb Schwab died while riding on a raft with two women that went airborne, striking a metal pole meant to support a netting system safety feature and was decapitated while the two other raft riders suffered serious injuries, the Kansas City Star reports.
