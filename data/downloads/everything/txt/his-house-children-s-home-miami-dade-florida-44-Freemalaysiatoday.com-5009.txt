Former PM criticises 'cavalier and irresponsible' manner in which police raids were conducted.



Police have been conducting investigations at the private homes of former PM Najib Razak and his family.

PETALING JAYA: Former Prime Minister Najib Razak today hit out at police personnel who demanded that meals be prepared for them when they raided his children’s homes.


In a statement issued by his lawyer today, Najib also criticised the “cavalier and irresponsible” manner in which the raid was conducted.

“This is reflected by the manner in which police personnel helped themselves to food and chocolates in the refrigerator,” he said, adding the widespread publicity surrounding the seizure of other belongings has embarrassed and humiliated his family.
