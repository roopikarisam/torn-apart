SAINT JOHNS, Mich. (WILX) - Former Ingham County Prosecutor Stuart Dunnings III walked away free from the Clinton County Jail early Sunday morning.

Just after midnight Dunnings III walked away with only a few items in his hand. He was quickly picked up and taken away.

Dunnings made no comment, hardly eye contact with reporters as he was being picked up by two men. 

Dunnings, locked up since last November, was allowed out of jail early due to good behavior. 

He pleaded guilty to prostitution and public misconduct in August of 2016.

Following an investigation by the Ingham County Sheriff's Office, Dunnings was arrested in March of 2016. 

He was originally charged with 15 crimes including a felony count of pandering that could have gotten him 20 years in prison. He eventually pleaded guilty to two charges and was sentenced to a year in jail. 

Investigators say Dunnings paid for sex "hundreds of times" with different women between 2010 and 2015.

In August 2016 Dunnings's law license was automatically suspended when he plead guilty to a felony charge of misconduct in office as well as a misdemeanor count of engaging the services of a prostitute.

By July 2017 the Federal District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan officially suspended Dunnings law license and is no longer allowed to practice in Michigan. 

Dunnings was lodged at the Clinton County Jail for safety reasons. 

In addition to jail time, Dunnings will also be on probation for three years.
