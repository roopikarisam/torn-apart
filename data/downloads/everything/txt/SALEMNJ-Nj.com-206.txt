MONROE TWP. -- A township man was charged with attempted luring after he allegedly approached a group of juveniles and offered to perform sex acts on some of them, police said.

Junior Sowell, 18, of Lakeside Drive, approached the juveniles -- three boys and two girls -- on Friday in the area of Victory Avenue, according to a criminal complaint.

"Mr. Sowell offered to perform oral sex on the three males on multiple occasions," police state in the report.

He allegedly tried to persuade the youths to walk behind a nearby house so that he could perform the acts.

The juveniles provided statements to police.

Sowell appeared to be under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of the alleged incident, police reported.

He was charged with three counts of attempted luring and placed in Salem County Correctional Facility pending a detention hearing.
