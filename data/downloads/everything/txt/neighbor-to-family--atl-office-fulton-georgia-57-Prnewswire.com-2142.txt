DALLAS, Oct. 26, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- After successfully raising nearly $3,500 for Marcus Autism Center in July, Atlanta-area On The Border Mexican Grill &amp; Cantina® restaurants have announced plans to continue participating in fundraising efforts for Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. The Marcus Autism Center is a non-profit subsidiary of Children's Healthcare of Atlanta that treats nearly 5,000 children with autism and related disorders every year.

The next fundraiser will take place during the month of November to benefit the Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center of Children's Healthcare of Atlanta. The Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center is one of the leading childhood cancer and blood disorders programs in the country. Combining the latest proven technology and research with a caring, child-friendly approach, makes the Aflac Cancer Center a top choice for the treatment of common and complex cancer and blood disorder conditions. 

All guests of On The Border who make a donation of at least $5 to Children's Healthcare of Altanta and the Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center will receive a coupon worth $5 off their next On The Border order of $15 or more. The $5 donation drive will begin November 1, 2017 at all Atlanta-area OTB locations and continue through November 30, 2017 with the hope of raising $12,000 by month's end.

"The entire Atlanta community has been very supportive of On The Border – welcoming us from the start and as we've expanded. We're proud to return that good-neighbor spirit through efforts like these that benefit all of Atlanta's children," said Ashley Zickefoose, Chief Marketing Officer for On The Border. 

Guests wishing to make their $5 donation to Children's Healthcare of Atlanta may visit the following OTB locations: 

"$5 goes a long way," Zickefoose explained. "For us, it's a margarita, a delicious order of queso, or even a pair of our Taco Fix Tuesday™ $2 tacos… but for kids who rely on Children's Healthcare of Atlanta it adds up to life-saving screenings, medications, therapies, and family support. We are happy to support their ongoing efforts however we can."
