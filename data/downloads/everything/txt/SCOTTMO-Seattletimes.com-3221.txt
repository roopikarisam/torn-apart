CORVALLIS, Ore. (AP) — A Corvallis city worker has been arrested after police say he sexually abused a girl younger than 14.

The Gazette-Times reports that Richard Knudson was booked into the Benton County Jail on charges of sex abuse, public indecency and unlawful sexual penetration. He pleaded not guilty at his arraignment.

Benton County Sheriff Scott Jackson said the girl spoke with authorities Sunday. Detectives interviewed Knudson the following day and arrested him. The alleged abuse occurred between September and February.

City spokesman Patrick Rollens said Knudson is a public works employee for the wastewater plant. Though he works for Corvallis, he lives in Philomath. He’s a former volunteer assistant coach for the girls’ softball team at Philomath High.
