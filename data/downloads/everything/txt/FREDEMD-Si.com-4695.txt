Every season, each NFL team nominates one player for the Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year Award, which acknowledges a player for his community service activities off the field, as well as his play on the field. Headlining this year’s list, not surprisingly, is Texans defensive end J.J. Watt, who raised $37 million over 19 days for Hurricane Harvey relief. But another headline of the 2017 class involves the many nominees who reflect this unique point in NFL history, where the intersection of sports, politics and minority rights have defined the season. There’s a new kind of Man of the Year candidate, one whose community work focuses on fighting social injustices.

Of the 32 nominees, seven players were nominated specifically by their teams for their work in raising awareness of social injustice, ranging participating in police ride-alongs to organizing meetings with state senators. A year after Colin Kaepernick’s original anthem protest, 12 of the 32 nominees have been involved in some form of anthem demonstration this season, either sitting, kneeling or raising a fist.

“It’s a new wave, definitely,” says Titans linebacker Wesley Woodyard, who has raised his fist during the anthem, starting in 2016. “Normally you get guys that are afraid to stand up, they don’t want to be released or they don’t want to face contract issues, but  when I see a man like [Eagles safety] Malcolm Jenkins or [Dolphins receiver] Kenny Stills, standing up for something they believe and not backing down, to me, that is a true American.”

Both Jenkins and Stills are Man of the Year nominees for their activism against racial inequality and social injustice. Jenkins’s efforts are focused on criminal justice reform, working to pass Clean Slate legislation that would seal old, non-violent misdemeanor offenses for Pennsylvanians who have not had any additional convictions for at least 10 years. Stills has spent time fostering the relationship between law enforcement and children in Miami. Last season he organized a town hall meeting with community leaders and law enforcement to discuss issues of racial inequality and how the parties could work to build understanding.

Stills left the town hall meeting with an idea to participate in police ride-alongs, where he would join police to stop by parks after school to hang out with local kids. “Just to help the law enforcement to build a relationship with the kids in those communities and build some type of trust and some familiarity with each other,” Stills says. “We can stop some negative things from happening by building these bonds.”

Dolphins receiver Kenny Stills works with local police officers to improve their relationship with the Miami community. 

He’s also helped organize CommUNITY tailgates before every Dolphins home game, which bring local student-athletes, coaches, parents, community leaders, law enforcement and military personnel together to build relationships across races and economic backgrounds.

“I’m trying to make our country stand for what we say we stand for,” Still says. “We say we believe in justice for all, we say we believe in equality, and freedom of speech and then when people are currently protesting, people have an issue with that, or when a  police officer kills a young man or a young woman, they don’t serve any time. So, it’s just my goal is to hold this country accountable to the standards that we say we believe in.”

In an arrangement with the Players Coalition, a group led in part by Jenkins, the NFL recently pledged to donate nearly $89 million over seven years to projects central to Stills and Jenkins’ focuses—criminal justice reform, law enforcement, community relations and education. The pledge represents the largest amount the NFL would spend on a social cause—more than the Salute to Service and Breast Cancer Awareness/Crucial Catch platforms.

Woodyard’s own community work reflects another current social cause, the women’s movement. Woodyard’s charity, 16Ways, is involved in a number of efforts, including a program called GYRLS, an acronym for “giving yourself respect and love,” that provides mentorship for girls as they transition to the teen years, developing self-esteem and providing positive direction through activities such as job shadowing, financial education and health and wellness talks. Woodyard’s daughters, two-year-old Noah and nine-month-old Luca, serve as the inspiration for the program. “I just want to try to make it a better world for everybody, but definitely for my daughters,” he says. “We’re just trying to get our girls to see that they hold all the power in their hands and they can do whatever they want to do in life. I think it is important that our females see Hillary Clinton running for president; that’s the first time anyone has seen that. We just want to show them keep dreaming and if you want to be an astronaut, you can be an astronaut. Doctor? You can be a doctor.”

Falcons guard Ben Garland never takes a week off from community service. He tries to participate in one or two events per week and at least 63 charity events per year. Garland graduated from the Air Force Academy and fulfilled his two-year service duty, so he spends much of his community service time with veterans recovering from wounds or dealing with PTSD. Garland’s motivation comes from the knowledge that his career and his NFL platform won’t last forever. “We have a small time frame where we can use this [NFL] shield to make a large difference,” he says. “I’ve had kids come back to me—when I talked to them they were 13 years old and now they’re 18 or 19, and they tell me that some small speech I gave to them in a classroom  way back when has really changed their lives. That stuff is incredible to hear.”

While all the nominees are worthy, Woodyard can’t see Jenkins, Stills or Garland upsetting Watt for the award. He says he’d even vote for the Texans star if he could. “If I had to cast a vote, I would vote J.J.,” says Woodyard. “To see what Houston went through, the crisis they had there with the hurricane and the flood, just to see how quick he was able to get that momentum rolling.”
