A Butler County Jail officer has been fired after officials say she “engaged in sexual activity” with at least one inmate


Nakisha Newell initially was accused of bringing a cell phone and cigarettes into the jail.


During an investigation into those claims, investigators discovered that Newell and an inmate “had engaged in sexual activity,” Butler County Sheriff Rick Jones said in a statement Monday. She was immediately fired, Jones said.


Newell had worked as a corrections officer for 18 months. She is charged with sexual battery, a third-degree felony, but more charges are expected.


“My employees take pride in their work and strive to ensure this facility maintains a great reputation,” Jones said in a statement. “She has tarnished that and I do not want people like that working for me.”
