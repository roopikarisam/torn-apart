BELMONT COUNTY, Ohio (WTRF) - Belmont County officials arrested three people this weekend on drug charges.


On Saturday night, at approximately 7:40, deputies with the Belmont County Sheriff's Office were called to the Route 214/I-470 pull-off for two people acting suspicious, who "may be doing drugs in a vehicle".


When Sheriff's Deputies responded, they discovered Daniel Magers, 30, of Barnesville and Sascha Wise, 29, of Woodsfield. The two reportedly were not cooperating with officials.


K9 Hyra was called in to the scene, and she indicated a positive indication for drugs. This gave officers probable cause to search the vehicle.


Sheriff's Deputies discovered heroin, cocaine, and drug instruments.


Magers has posted bond, and is facing charges of Possession of Drug Instruments, Possession of Heroin, and Possession of Schedule 1 and 2 Substances.


Wise is being held on a $3,250 bond, and is facing charges of Possession of Drug Instruments and Possession of Cocaine.


Later Saturday evening, at approximately 9:06, Belmont County officials were called to the scene of a local hotel.


Members of the Major Crime Unit Drug Division, including St. Clairsville PD and Belmont County Sheriff's Office, launched an investigation that led to the arrest of Joseph Nobles.


Officials seized narcotics and cash out of Nobles's hotel room.


Nobles, 26, of Corrigan, Texas, is charged with Trafficking in Drugs (F3).


Nobles has posted his $10,000 bond and is currently out of jail.
