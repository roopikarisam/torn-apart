BIG STONE GAP, Va.—The Wise County Sheriff's Office continues to search for a man they say escaped from jail custody.

Samuel Jackson Penley escaped from the Southwest Virginia Regional Jail Authority at Duffield while at the Lonesome Pine Hospital, the Sheriff's Office said Friday in a written statement. Penley has been serving time for resisting arrest and several other charges.

Penley was wearing orange coveralls and was last seen in the southern side of Big Stone Gap. On Saturday, authorities said they believe Penley was also in possession of a stolen blue 2006 Dodge Caravan with Virginia tag number WMT-6279. The vehicle has a missing hubcap, minor body damage and an expired Virginia inspection sticker, the Sheriff’s Office said.

The U.S. Marshals Service has also authorized a $1,000 reward for information leading to Penley’s arrest. The Virginia State Police is also assisting in the search.

“We advised people to lock their doors for their individual safety and be aware and report any suspicious activity,” Sheriff’s Office Col. Grant Kilgore said.

Anyone with information is asked to call 911.
