Nick, the 2-year-old white and gray pit bull mix that was stolen from a Boston animal shelter more than a month ago, was finally returned safe and sound Tuesday evening, officials said.


“He’s healthy and doing great! A Good Samaritan reported Nick last night and we couldn’t be happier!” Boston’s Animal Rescue League tweeted on Wednesday. 


A “concerned citizen” contacted the MSPCA-Angell call center with a tip about Nick and his location late Tuesday night, the league said in a Facebook post on Wednesday. MSPCA immediately alerted league officials, who picked the dog up and brought him back to the Boston center. 


Nick went missing from the league’s Boston Animal Care and Adoption Center on April 15, when a potential adopter did not return to the shelter after taking Nick for a walk, the league said on Facebook. The man left a state-issued ID card with the shelter, but never came back for it.


The league was offering a $1,000 reward to anyone with information about Nick’s whereabouts. 


“Over the past six weeks the search for Nick has been priority number one,” the Wednesday Facebook post said. “ARL is overwhelmed with joy to have Nick back with the organization.”


Nick will undergo a medical and behavioral evaluation and is not currently available for adoption, the post said.
