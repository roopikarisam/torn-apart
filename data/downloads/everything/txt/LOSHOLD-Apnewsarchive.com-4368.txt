LOS ANGELES (AP) â€” Los Angeles police say an officer was hospitalized after his patrol car was struck on a major highway that was shut down for hours after the crash.

Officer Irma Mota says the officer suffered a serious leg injury in the collision late Monday on Interstate 405 on the city's west side.

All northbound lanes were initially shut down during the investigation but the California Highway Patrol opened one lane around 5:30 a.m. Tuesday.

The Los Angeles Times reports one person is in custody in connection with the case.
