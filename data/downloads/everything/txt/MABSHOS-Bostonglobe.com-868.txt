A Pembroke woman was indicted Tuesday by a grand jury on 10 counts, including motor vehicle homicide while driving under the influence, in connection with an October crash in Brockton that left one person dead and two others seriously injured, authorities said. 


Danielle Mastro, 33, 
 will also face charges of motor vehicle manslaughter by operating under the influence, leaving the scene of a death and negligent operation of a motor vehicle, the Plymouth district attorney’s office said in a press release.


On Oct. 3, Mastro was involved in a chain reaction crash involving an SUV and a dump truck at about 3:30 p.m. on Quincy Street. She was driving an Audi A6 when she rear-ended a Chevy Equinox, which then veered into the other side of the street and into the path of a 12-wheel heavy dump truck, officials said.


“The impact caused the truck to rollover and lose its load before coming to a rest on its side,” prosecutors said. 



The driver of the Chevy, Deborah Combra, 58, of Bridgewater, was pronounced dead at Brockton Hospital.  She was a procurement officer at the state Department of Mental Health’s Brockton office, the state said. 


Her female passenger, a coworker who was not identified, was taken to Brockton’s Good Samaritan Medical Center for treatment. The driver of the dump truck, who was not identified, was treated at another hospital, according to the release.


Mastro fled the scene on foot, police said, but was located and arrested a few minutes later. 



At her arraignment, Mastro told authorities that she was “dope sick” and likely texting her drug dealer at the time of the crash. She was ordered held on $50,000 cash bail.
