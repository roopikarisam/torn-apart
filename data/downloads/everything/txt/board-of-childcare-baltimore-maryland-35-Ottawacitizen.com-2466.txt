The province will spend $10.5 million for a new French Catholic elementary school in the fast-growing south end of Ottawa.


The funding announcement made Thursday is great news for parents in Riverside South, Leitrim, Greely, Metcalfe and Blossom Park, said Johanne Lacombe, the chair of the Conseil des écoles catholiques du Centre-Est. The new kindergarten-to-Grade 6 school will take some of the pressure off the board’s Bernard-Grandmaître elementary school, which is full.


The new school will be built at the intersection of Ralph Hennessy Avenue and Mount Nebo Road. It will be large enough for 412 students and have 49 childcare spaces, according to news releases from the board and the province. The board says it will open in the fall of 2019.


The Education Ministry also approved several renovations at schools in the area: an addition to Elmdale school in Ottawa’s English public board; an addition to the English Catholic St. Joseph High School in Ottawa; an addition with 73 child care spaces to The English Catholic St. Joseph High School in Renfrew County; and an addition with 15 child care spaces to the French public elementary school Nouvel Horizon in Hawkesbury.


The province announced last month that it would provide $37 million to build the first English public high school in Stittsville.
