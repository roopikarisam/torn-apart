FAYETTEVILLE, Ark. (KNWA) -- A mother who was initially arrested after her baby was found dead is now at large after bonding out of jail, authorities say. 


The Fort Smith Police Department said Sierra Johnson, 20, was arrested earlier in the week on suspicion of permitting the abuse of a minor. She was booked into the Sebastian County Detention Center but later released on bond. 


Now a warrant has been issued for her arrest, and she faces a charge of petition to revoke bond. Police said officers haven't been able to find her. 


Anyone with information on her location is encouraged to call police at 479-709-5100.
