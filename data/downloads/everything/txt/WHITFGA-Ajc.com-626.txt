A North Georgia high school teacher was arrested Wednesday after she brought heroin onto the school’s campus, according to a release from the Whitfield County Sheriff’s Office.


Raquel Eleana Spencer is also believed to have been under the influence of narcotics at the time of her arrest, Sheriff Scott Chitwood said. 


Staff and students at Northwest Whitfield High School noticed Spencer behaving unusually and notified school officials, according to the Dalton Daily Citizen. 


Administrators checked on Spencer and escorted her to the office, the paper reported. Spencer consented to a search. The heroin was found on Spencer’s personal property, Chitwood said. 


She was taken to the Whitfield County jail and faces a heroin possession charge.  


Spencer is an English teacher at the high school, where she has been employed since 2013, the newspaper reported. She also serves as assistant cheerleading coach and assistant girls track and field coach. 


School officials said Spencer will be placed on administrative leave once she is released from jail. 


No other details were released.
