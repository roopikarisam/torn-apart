FRANKLIN TWP. -- Two Cumberland County residents found with 100 bags of heroin in their car also had two small children in the vehicle when they were stopped by police, authorities said.

Township police stopped a suspicious vehicle in the parking lot of a business in the 4400 block of Harding Highway on Tuesday evening.

After a Vineland Police K-9 reported narcotics in the vehicle, police obtained a search warrant and found the drugs, according to a press release from Franklin Township Police.

Deandre Kates, 23, of Millville, and Adora Mosley, 24, of Bridgeton, were each charged Friday with possession and distribution of heroin, endangering the welfare of a child and failure to surrender narcotics.

Mosley was also charged with driving while suspended and having improper child restraints.

Kates was jailed at Salem County Correctional Facility pending a detention hearing, while Mosley was released on a summons.

The state Division of Child Protection and Permanency was called in regarding the children, police said.
