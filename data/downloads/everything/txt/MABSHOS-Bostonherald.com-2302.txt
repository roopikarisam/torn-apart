BOSTON  â€” Massachusetts' highest court said the state's former prisons chief who was pressured to resign amid concerns about his handling of an investigation at a maximum-security psychiatric hospital can't return to his old job in the department.


The Supreme Judicial Court ruled Tuesday in the case of Luis Spencer, who resigned as Department of Correction commissioner in 2014. After his resignation, Spencer wanted to return to his job as a correctional officer.
