HOUSTON, Nov. 17, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Medistar Corporation ("Medistar") announced today that it has begun development of a major medical tower, located at 6700 Main Street, the home of the Best Western hotel, which will soon be demolished. The site is strategically positioned immediately adjacent to the Texas Medical Center, the largest medical complex in the world with 50 million square feet of buildings on 1,345 acres and supporting 10 million patient encounters annually. Medistar's modern Class A medical tower will be 550,000 square feet, featuring an expanded floorplate that can support the requirements of a major medical destination, oversized parking garage and retail at ground level.


              


Connected by sky bridges to Medistar's new 22-story InterContinental® Houston Medical Center hotel and 35-story LATITUDE Med Center luxury apartment tower for the convenience of patients and others, the medical tower has been designed for a hospital, doctor offices, ancillary services as well as other uses of healthcare companies.


The hotel and apartment project includes 1.2 million square feet of upscale hospitality and residential solutions to meet the growing market demand of the Texas Medical Center – which annually attracts a tremendously high volume of domestic and international patients – as well as for the needs of the entire community.


Planning and design for the new medical tower is the result of Medistar's decades-long relationships in the Middle East and Asia, and also with doctors and other healthcare providers in the Texas Medical Center. The residential and hospitality aspects of the project were designed to complement each other in meeting the needs of the diverse, vibrant Texas Medical Center community. This new medical tower further enhances the project with unparalleled walkable convenience to the Texas Medical Center, privacy and coordination of care – especially important to patients and families from across the U.S. and abroad. Its location is one block from the MetroRail transit station, providing further convenience and accessibility.


Medistar has made the patient and provider experience the focal point of this landmark development. Designed to the quality standards of today's most modern hospitals, the medical tower features robust, secure technologies that interact with QR code wearable cards to enhance patient safety, security, clinical accuracy and operational efficiency. With the hotel and apartments, the new medical tower provides a unique solution for the delivery of high-quality, efficient and coordinated outpatient and home health services.


In addition to serving patient-guests and their families, this three-building complex meets the diverse, growing and continually evolving needs of the global health science industry, including universities, healthcare systems, pharmaceutical companies, genomics companies, medical equipment manufacturers, medical device companies, physicians, executives, researchers, scientists, medical students, residents, life sciences professionals, and healthcare and life science associations from the U.S. and abroad.


Medistar is in active discussions about the new medical tower with major healthcare companies seeking to create or expand their presence in the Texas Medical Center.
