A Secaucus resident found himself in Hudson County jail when a jaywalking violation turned into a drug arrest last week, police said.

Steve Baekey, 42, was approached by police after he crossed County Avenue against a red light at 3:22 p.m. on June 19, Secaucus Police Capt. Dennis Miller said.

Baekey was arrested on an outstanding warrant in the amount of $300 from Newark. Police then found that he was in possession of heroin and he was charged with drug possession, Miller said.



Baekey was then taken to Hudson County jail, Miller said.
