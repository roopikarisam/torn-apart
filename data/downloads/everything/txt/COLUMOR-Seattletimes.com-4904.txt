COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) — A woman has been arrested in the stabbing death of a man at a Columbia apartment complex.

Columbia police tell local media outlets that 23-year-old Zhane Pride was arrested Wednesday and charged with murder and possession of a weapon with a violent crime.

Officers say Pride and the 27-year-old man knew each other and argued before the stabbing. The man was stabbed in the lower body and died after being taken to the hospital. His name has not been released.

Pride was being held in the Richland County jail. It wasn’t known if she had an attorney.
