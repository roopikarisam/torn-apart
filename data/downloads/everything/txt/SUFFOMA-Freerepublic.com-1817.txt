Press collusion angers me. 


Media news outlets should have to register together as a PAC, or as a lobbying group, working for the DNC, if they are going to all collaborate on its behalf. 


I was watching Fox 25 News in Boston at 6:00 tonight, and they ran a human interest piece on some illegal immigrant who is being released from jail. 


"He has been in the country for years," says the newslady in an overdub, "and has never committed a crime. . . . He was jailed for entering the country illegally . . ." 


No apology was offered for that contradiction. 


"His two daughters have cried every night since he was taken from them . . . " she went on. 


Please. Every night? 


There was a camera clip of them looking sad. 


He was then shown, speaking in front of a microphone, with a bunch of SEIU members behind him (their signs said that) looking concerned, talking about how terrible it is that there has been a crackdown on immigration. And the Fox Newswoman narrating the story agreed, and got in a dig at the Trump administration policies. And that was the end of the story. 


I went to the Fox @% Boston website, to get a transcript of the story, but it hasn't been posted yet. 


So I Googled the story. 


Look at the results below. 


Remember, this story just broke. 


Is it credible that all of these news outlets independently stumbled upon this humble janitor's story, out of the near-infinite number of stories in America, at the same time, without some sort of JournoList coordinating body saying "Let's all run this story"? 


Also remember: this is the same national news media that claimed it didn't cover the Dr. Kermit Gosnell trial because it was "just a local story." And other stories they found embarrassing to their causes. 


There is truly a news cabal controlled at the national level.

“Is it credible that all of these news outlets independently stumbled upon this humble janitor’s story, out of the near-infinite number of stories in America, at the same time, without some sort of JournoList coordinating body saying “Let’s all run this story”? “

The various “news” services subscribe to what used to be called “the wire.” This from the telegraph days. Not all newspapers could afford to have a reporter in exotic places like London or Berlin. The AP puts a story on “the wire” and anybody can use it.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Associated_Press

Yes, I know the AP circulated this to many of the news outlets — some appear to be more honest than others about attributing it the AP, by the way — but others have apparently crafted their own stories from this nugget of information on one janitor in one city in one county in one state in this country.

Rush L frequently plays clips from newies using the exact same words and phrases to report current events.

Of course there is collusion. They get their material from the same resource pool and don’t bother to change the wording.

==

I figured that out 30 years ago. I did not have cable, so I would watch the major 3 networks. Occasionally, one would run their news at 30 minutes ahead or behind the others, so I would be able to watch 2 network news programs.

Nearly every evening they ran 90% of the same stories, and many of those were almost word-for-word. They would change the order, but the contents were basically the same.

AP has been a promoter of Progressivism for a hundred years.

Hard to deny collusion when they are marching lock step with one another.

And why wasn’t this illegal Mexican deported?

Like most papers, they pay for articles from the original source.
I have a running feud with a local paper here.
They fill the paper with articles from WAPO,NYT,AP etc...when these places print a retraction, it’s never posted in my local paper, so Fake News runs supreme.

I took a random sampling of the links you provided.

www.macon.com - article is credited to AP
www.resgistercitizen.com - article is credited to AP
www.fox25boston.com - no author credited - FOX25 does the interview
www.wate.com/ - article is credited to AP


 






 



 


 Life imitates art. To some.


I had a kid work as an intern at a local paper. Much of the content was copy/pasted from press releases.

It’s the Ministry of Propaganda, of course it is orchestrated.

The “poor illegal alien” stories have been coming out faster and faster as they work up to another amnesty attempt.

It’s not collusion.

It’s called gaslighting.

I guess you’ve never seen these?

 Amen. I've been saying this for years. Press collusion is done for the purpose of manipulating elections to favor Democrats, and it needs to be prevented or people need to be fined for doing it.
