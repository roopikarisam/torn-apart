CASA GRANDE, Ariz. (AP) — Pinal County’s top prosecutor wants to re-emphasize a diversion program for individuals whose minor offenses might otherwise put them behind bars for a year.

Pinal County Attorney Kent Volkmer says it doesn’t make sense to incarcerate everyone for every mistake that they make.

The Casa Grande Dispatch reported Tuesday that the diversion program allows individuals who may be charged with a crime to participate in community service and educational programs in hopes of remedying the behavior that initiated the original arrest.

Charges against participants are dropped at the end of the program.

Volkmer’s office is also re-examining how it charges individuals who’ve previously been convicted of a felony.

According to Volkmer, the changes have lowered jail population numbers and freed up more time for police officers.
