BRIDGETON, N.J. (AP) â€” Three corrections officers at a New Jersey jail are facing charges stemming from the suicides of two inmates.

Thirty-one-year-old Tabatha Roman is charged with endangering another person. Authorities have charged 27-year-old Nicolas Gomez and 40-year-old Justin Cimino with tampering with public records.

All three work at the Cumberland County Jail in Bridgeton.

Prosecutors say Roman created a "substantial risk of death" in connection with the hanging death of a 21-year-old inmate in February. Prosecutors say Gomez and Cimino falsified forms in the hanging death of another inmate.

An attorney representing Cimino and Roman says the charges have no merit. The union representing the officers says it stands by them and asked for patience until the facts come out.

All three have been suspended without pay.
