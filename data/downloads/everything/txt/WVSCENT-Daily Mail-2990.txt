A West Virginia man has been accused of assaulting his 37-week pregnant girlfriend and injecting her with methamphetamine without her consent.


News outlets reported Tuesday that the criminal complaint against 21-year-old Kyle Wilson Stowers says he struck his girlfriend in the head, face and torso and hit her legs with a baseball bat.


The incident occurred at a Charleston home four days before Christmas on December 21.


Kyle Wilson Stowers, 21, of West Virginia has been accused of assaulting his 37-week pregnant girlfriend and injecting her with methamphetamine without her consent

After injecting the woman with meth in her right arm, against her will, he fled the premise, however he was captured shortly after. It is unclear at this stage as to what Stowers' motive was.








The woman, who is almost nine months pregnant, told police that Stowers 'left her for dead.'  


'Typically one in four women will experience domestic violence in her lifetime which is a terrible statistic in and of itself,' explained Jennifer Goddard with the YWCA (a nonprofit organization dedicated to eliminating racism and empowering women) in Charleston, reported WSAZ3. 


'So they may leave, and then go back. There are so many factors that weigh against people when they're trying to leave,' Goddard explained.


Stowers has been charged with assault and malicious wounding and is currently residing in South Central Regional Jail.


He facing a potential ten years in jail if he is given the maximum sentence.


His bail has been set at $10,000 - it is unclear if he has a lawyer or not.


It is also unclear what condition the expectant mother and her unborn child are in at this stage.
