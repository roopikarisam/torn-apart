Former Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) middleweight Jason Miller, incredibly, is still not behind bars, which is kind of amazing when you consider how many times he’s been arrested over the past few years.

We’re talking about a guy who forced a standoff with the SWAT team.

Nevertheless, Miller, 36, managed to avoid (additional) jail time after recently pleading guilty to domestic violence in Orange County, Calif., walking away with three-year’s probation and a four-year suspended prison sentence.

From TMZ:

Court docs show Mayhem was charged with five counts of felony domestic violence in Sept. -- along with one felony count of vandalizing a girlfriend’s car and house. He was also hit with misdemeanors for damaging two girlfriends' cell phones to prevent them from calling cops. Per the terms of his deal, Mayhem will be released to a sobriety treatment program and must remain clean for the entire term of his probation.

“Mayhem” was credited for 62 days already served in the slammer.

Miller (23-10, 1 NC) has not been seen since a submission loss to Mattia Schiavolin under the Venator FC banner in early 2016. The bout was just his third since getting cut from UFC way back in 2011 and also marked his third straight defeat.

Hopefully the longtime veteran can get his personal life back on track before something bad happens (like this).
