TULSA, Okla. (AP) â€” A Tulsa County detention officer has surrendered to authorities after a warrant was issued for her arrest on a charge of sexual battery.

The Tulsa County sheriff's office said in a release late Friday that Ashley Michelle Smith had turned herself in at the county jail. A warrant for her arrest was signed by a judge earlier Friday.

Authorities say Smith is accused of having an inappropriate sexual relationship with an inmate at the jail. Smith has been on administrative leave since September 8 when the allegation surfaced. She was hired as a detention officer in May of this year.
