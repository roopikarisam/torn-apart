Police have revealed that New York Giants player Janoris Jenkins’ brother William is a person of interest in the ongoing investigation into a recently discovered dead body.

The body of Roosevelt Rene was found in the New Jersey home of the star cornerback Tuesday, and it’s absolutely dominated the news ever since. Now, it looks like police would like to sit down with William to ask him a couple questions. (RELATED: POLICE ARE INVESTIGATING A DEAD BODY FOUND IN NFL STAR’S HOME. HERE’S WHAT WE KNOW)

TMZ reported the following Wednesday:

We spoke with Ontario County NY District Attorney James Ritts … who tells us, “William Jenkins is a person of interest in relation to [the] dead body case at his brother’s house.”

“Bergen County wants to talk to him.”

Here’s the twist … according to jail records obtained by TMZ Sports, 34-year-old William Jenkins was arrested in upstate NY on June 26 at 1:46 a.m. EST … about nine hours BEFORE the body was discovered at JJ’s home.

This is such a wild situation. According to TMZ, William was arrested on some parole violation but doesn’t specify what that means at all. He’s also apparently not a suspect at this time.

I don’t know why, but this situation just seems like it’s going to go down a dark rabbit hole. How is a body just found in the home of an NFL star? How? Janoris has reportedly been out of the area for a while at the Giants’ mini-camp, which makes this situation even stranger.

Who has been going in his house? How did a dead body get there? This also doesn’t sound like there’s much of a chance that it was an accident. Police have called the death “highly suspicious.”

Stay tuned for more updates, and keep checking The Smoke Room to find out what is going on with the case everybody is talking about in the NFL.
