SAN DIEGO, Feb. 6, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Petco, a leading specialty retailer of premium pet food, supplies and services, today announced its expansion of the company's pet services offerings with an additional in-store veterinary hospital in one Dallas, Texas store.

Each Pet Vet hospital offers full-service medical and urgent care seven days a week, spay and neuter, full in-house diagnostic laboratory equipment, advanced ultrasounds, dentistry and more. The Pet Vet also offers pet parents and their pets a comprehensive wellness plan for every stage of a pet's life.
