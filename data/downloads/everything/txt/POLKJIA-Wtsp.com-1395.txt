Teneroc High School football head coach and former NFL player Laroni Gallishaw was arrested Friday on drug charges.


Gallishaw's car was stopped by a Polk County deputy about 11:40 p.m. for an expired tag. During a search of the car, the deputy said he found a razor blade with a small amount of cocaine in a cup holder. 

Gallishaw, 37, was arrested and transported to the Polk County Jail.


At the jail, while waiting to be booked-in, a deputy said he noticed Gallishaw reaching into his underwear, then attempt to hide something in the seat next to him. A deputy entered the holding cell, and found what was determined to be a rock of cocaine and a small amount of marijuana. 


Gallishaw was charged with possession of cocaine, introducing contraband to the jail, tampering with evidence, possession of marijuana and possession of paraphernalia. He was released after posting $3,000 bail.


Polk County schools Superintendent Jacqueline Byrd says the district will begin the process of firing Gallishaw immediately.


Gallishaw played with the 1999 state champion Lakeland Dreadnaughts football team. He played college ball at Louisville and Murray State, and played with the Minnesota Vikings in 2005. He was named Teneroc head coach in July 2017.
