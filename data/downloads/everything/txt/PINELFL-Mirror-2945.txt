A woman is suing a T-Mobile worker who found a sex tape on her phone when she took it into a store - and emailed it to himself.

Keely Hightower, 24, said how her "heart dropped" when she noticed an explicit clip in her trash folder the day after she visited the branch of T-Mobile in Pinellas Park, Florida.

The video is understood to show Keely engaging in sex acts in a bed - with her face said to be clearly visible in parts of the footage.

Ms. Hightower is said to have identified a T-Mobile employee, named Roberto Aramis Sanchez Ramos - the man who served her in the store - as the recipient of the file after recognising his email address.

Keely told US media she feared the sex tape would go public and does not know what was done with the video after the file was sent.

She told the Tampa Bay Times: "My thought was just like where did the video go? What happened after that?"

"That was my main concern ... I didnâ€™t want the video out there in the public."

Ramos, 26, is believed to have roused Keely's suspicions when he took an "unusually long time to return the phone", WPXI reported.

Police were called and Ramos later admitted a computer offence charge for which he was jailed for six months.

He was reportedly released from Pinellas County Jail in October.

Now it's believed Keely is suing Ramos and Global Innovative Group, the company that owns the store, on negligence grounds claiming she suffered "mental anguish and emotional distress".

The lawyer working on behalf told the Tampa Bay Times it was unacceptable Ramos was working at the store to start with.

The newspaper reported Ramos was on probation for defrauding a T-Mobile store at the time of his arrest.

Neither Ramos or Global Innovative Group have commented.
