HBO’s “Wyatt Cenac Problem Areas,” which debuted on the premium cable channel this month, will feature Elgin in its April 27 episode, according to HBO media relations officials.


Cenac and producers were in Elgin shortly after Christmas when Cenac interviewed Elgin Chief of Police Jeff Swoboda, Resident Officer Program of Elgin Officer Heather Farrell, School District U46 Board Member Traci Ellis, and activist Marcus Banner.


The comedy/documentary series stars Cenac and is co-produced by John Oliver. The half-hour comedic documentary series takes “a … satirical look at social and cultural issues from the former Daily Show correspondent’s unique perspective,” according to deadline.com and other online reports.


The first episode focused on the July 2016 shooting death of Philando Castile in Falcon Heights, Minn., and the Ramsey County Sheriff’s office which took over policing for Falcon Heights following the incident.


According to Swoboda, Cenac focused on Elgin’s ROPE program, which places officers in city-owned housing in higher-crime neighborhoods.


Elgin and its police department has had “a lot of national recognition because of our community involvement and strategies that are working,” Swoboda said in December.


The producers reached out again in March, following the shooting death of Decynthia Clements by Elgin Sgt. Chris Jensen and Swoboda’s pending exit to become chief in Fort Collins, Co.


Swoboda said he feels positive about how Elgin will look to the country in the series.

“Whenever you put yourself out there and allow others to tell your story it can be scary.  However in discussions with HBO they seemed genuine in their desire to tell stories down the middle — what’s working and what’s not. Policing can be messy at times and I hope they show Elgin for what we are; a city and a community that doesn’t hide our flaws. Instead we confront them and work hard to improve, Swoboda said.
