A 48-year-old woman is detained in King County Jail after a gay couple was assaulted in Capitol Hill Sunday and called homophobic slurs on the street.

The couple was walking north on Broadway East near East Denny Way in Seattle about 11:30 a.m. when a woman approached them and stopped next to them on the sidewalk, according to the incident report.

The woman yelled homophobic slurs at them several times and hit one of the men in the leg with a large suitcase, Seattle police say.

She then allegedly punched one of the men in the face and broke his sunglasses. The woman took sharp metal pieces of the sunglasses and chased after them, armed with shards in both hands.

The men were able to get away from the woman and police found her in the upper lot of the QFC on Broadway and East Pike Street, reports indicate.

The alleged victims identified her as the assailant.

Highest rates of crime for Seattle's "micro communities," based on the Seattle Police Department's crime statistics for 2017.

The woman reportedly continued to issue homophobic slur as she was arrested. She also called a police officer a racial epithet and, while in a patrol car on the way to jail, referred to a Starbucks barista with a racial slur.

Police booked the woman into King County Jail for investigation of two counts of malicious harassment -- Washington's hate crime statute -- and felony harassment.

She remains jailed on $30,000 bail.
