WOODBURY -- A Westville man faces 8 years in prison after pleading guilty this week to robbing a local business, according to the Gloucester County Prosecutor's Office.

Kevin L. Frymyer, 35, admitted that he walked into Bob's News Stand on Broadway in Westville in December of last year, displayed a knife and pushed a store employee in order to get to the cash register, authorities said.

Frymyer fled the store with $800 in cash.

He was arrested the next day after police posted surveillance video of the crime on Facebook.

He has remained in Salem County Correctional Facility since his arrest.

As part of a negotiated plea agreement on the robbery charge, the prosecutor's office will recommend an 8-year sentence.

Superior Court Judge Robert P. Becker scheduled sentencing for Oct. 27.
