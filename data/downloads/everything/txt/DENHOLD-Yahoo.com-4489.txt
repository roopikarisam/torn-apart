Head coach Todd Bowles confirmed on Monday that the New York Jets will be without starting quarterback Josh McCown for the rest of the season due to the broken left hand he suffered against the Denver Broncos.


Despite the injury being to McCown’s non-throwing hand, he must undergo surgery.


“I feel sorry for Josh,” Bowles said. “He was having a good year.”


McCown was having the best season of his 16-year career. His 13 starts, 67.3 percent completion mark, 2,926 yards passing and 18 touchdowns (against nine interceptions) are all career highs.


And he was able to do it with one of the more anonymous receiving corps in the NFL.


McCown could hardly hold back tears on Sunday as he spoke with reporters.


“It’s been the best (season) because of the guys. Not numbers,” McCown said. “It’s been the best because of the guys in the locker room.”


McCown’s play wasn’t the only surprising thing about the Jets this season; while many observers looked at their offseason moves and roster and predicted two wins tops, they have won five with three to play.


Bowles added that he and McCown didn’t talk about the quarterback’s future; McCown signed a one-year, $6 million deal with New York before the season.


Without McCown, 2015 fourth-round pick Bryce Petty will start this week against the Saints in New Orleans; according to Bowles, the offense won’t change much with Petty running things. Bowles added that he’s comfortable with Christian Hackenberg, last year’s second-round pick who has yet to see game action, getting some snaps.


Petty started four games last year, completing 58.5 percent of his passes with two touchdowns and five interceptions.


New York was 1-3 in his starts.
