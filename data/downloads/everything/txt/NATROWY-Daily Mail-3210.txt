A transgender woman found guilty of sexually assaulting a 10-year-old girl in a bathroom could face 70 years in jail.


Michelle Martinez - known as Miguel before identifying as a female - was convicted of first and second degree sexual abuse of a minor on Wednesday.


The young girl had told police that Martinez - from Casper, Wyoming - took her to a bathroom in a home before touching her breasts and genitalia.


She then penetrated the girl.

The victim told her mother about the ordeal with Martinez, who was a family friend.


She started to cry as she told police that 'it hurt inside.'


Nurses at Wyoming Medical Center then found redness and abrasions on the girl's genitalia. 


The girl told an interviewer from the Children's Advocacy Project that Martinez should be jailed, the Casper Star Tribune reported.


Martinez was then found passed out and 'extremely intoxicated' home. She denied the charges and became 'hostile and defensive' when questioned by police. She told the officers that the girl had been 'talking crap' earlier in the day. 


She also reportedly said the girl was lying and accused her of a 'publicity stunt' when the charges were brought in May.
