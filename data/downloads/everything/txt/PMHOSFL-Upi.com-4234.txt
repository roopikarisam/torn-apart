Dec. 19 (UPI) -- An African serval cat that escaped from its owner's South Carolina home has been recaptured after four months on the loose.

Christine Ismail, of Hardeeville, said Monday that her exotic pet, Toby, was captured Saturday in Palmetto Bluff after he was attacked by a dog and fled by swimming into a nearby pond.


A witness contacted the Palmetto Bluff Conservancy, which has been trying to capture Toby for months, and the rescuers were able to safely wrangle the serval, which was unable to flee due to being weak from malnutrition and the canine attack.

The cat, which escaped from Ismail's home through a window four months ago, was taken to Port Royal Veterinary Hospital, where he was treated for exposure, dehydration and suspected pneumonia.

"When he first came in, he was basically terrified," veterinarian Marikay Campbell told the Hilton Head Island Packet.

"He woke up very nicely [from sedation] and on Sunday morning he was alert," Campbell said. "He was ready to eat, and that's a big step forward."

The hospital said in a Facebook post on Sunday that Toby's condition was "stable."

"Toby is not strong right now, but with every meal he's getting better," Ismail said. "My cat is a survivor."
