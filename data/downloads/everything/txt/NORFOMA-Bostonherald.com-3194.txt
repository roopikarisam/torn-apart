Bernard Sigh — deemed an “imminent and clear danger” last week amid new sexual assault charges — is set to go back before a judge in Norfolk Superior Court today to challenge a ruling that he stay behind bars for at least the next four months.


Sigh, the brother-in-law of former Gov. Deval Patrick, is scheduled for a bail review hearing this afternoon in Dedham, roughly a week after a Quincy District Court judge ordered that he be held for at least 120 days.
