Rest in parking.

The mayor of Davenport, Fla., is accused of using a handicapped parking placard issued to a disabled people who died years ago just so she could get a better spot.

According to an arrest affidavit obtained by the Daily News, Mayor Teresa "Darlene" Bradley was placed under arrest Tuesday after deputies with the Polk County Sheriff's Office were tipped off that the elected official was using handicapped parking spaces despite suffering from no ailments.

Law enforcement proceeded to secretly record Bradley, 60, in the act.

"Video was also obtained of Mayor Teresa Bradley exiting the vehicle with no assistance, removing a large wheeled brief/suit case from the trunk and walking into the city hall meeting without assistance," her arrest affidavit states.

The Orlando Sentinel reportsauthorities located two placards inside her home, and while they haven't divulged how the three-term city leader came to possess them, deputies said one was issued to a Davenport woman who died in 2012 while the other was given to someone who died in 2015.

Additionally, one placard had expired in 2013 but was altered to read 2018.

She faces charges of identity theft, counterfeiting a decal and illegally parking in a handicapped spot, with the first two crimes beingthird-degree felonies.

Polk County Sheriff Grady Judd said in a statement, "We expect our elected officials to set the proper example. She not only violated the law, she embarrassed the citizens of Davenport with her illegal conduct."

She was released from Polk County Jail after posting a $2,250 bond.

City commissioners say they will hold an emergency meeting Thursday where they will meet "to discuss all options," the Washington Post reports.

Bradley failed to respond to a Daily News request for comment.
