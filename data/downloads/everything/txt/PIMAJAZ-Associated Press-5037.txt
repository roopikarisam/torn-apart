PHOENIX (AP) â€” Authorities say a southern Arizona man wanted by the FBI has been arrested.

Arizona Department of Transportation officials say their detectives used facial recognition training to track down 43-year-old Sandro Tentory.

The FBI had an outstanding felony warrant for Tentory for alleged weapons violations.

ADOT discovered that for 13 years, Tentory had two Arizona driver licenses using stolen information from two people living in Illinois.

Tentory was arrested June 7 at his Sahuarita home on suspicion of five counts of forgery and the felony warrant.

A search warrant was served and ADOT detectives found fraudulent identification cards, credit cards and loan documents that used the fake IDs.

Tentory has been booked into the Pima County Jail.

It was unclear Monday if he has a lawyer yet.
