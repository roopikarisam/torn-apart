Deputies have arrested four juveniles, two males and two females, in connection with a crime spree that included attempted murder, kidnapping, car thefts and burglaries.

The four, whose names weren’t released because of their ages, were arrested Wednesday, and a fifth juvenile is still being sought. El Paso County Sheriff’s Office spokeswoman Jacqueline Kirby said the male juvenile was last seen in Peyton and is armed and “very dangerous.”

One stolen vehicle, a burgundy Ford Explorer, was found with two of the suspects around 3 p.m. Another car, a white Mercedes, was found Tuesday afternoon.

Kirby declined to say where and when the other two suspects were captured except to say it followed a traffic crash.

She also did not release any details about the attempted murder, other than that it involved a shooting that was reported Monday.
