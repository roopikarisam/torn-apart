The Jersey Shore teen who killed four people on New Year's Eve — including his mother, father and sister — was ordered to remain in custody Wednesday.

Scott Kologi, 16, appeared before a Monmouth County Family Court Judge for the first time. No other details were released due to the gag order that was imposed to protect the minor's privacy.

Kologi was charged with four counts of first-degree murder in the killings of his parents Steven and Linda Kologi, his 18-year-old sister Brittany and his grandfather's partner Mary Schulz, 70.

Prosecutors say the autistic teen opened fire with a semi-automatic rifle inside his Long Branch home just 20 minutes before the clock struck midnight.

The victims were all shot multiple times at close range, and authorities were still working to determine the motive.

Prosecutors will seek to try Kologi as an adult. The mentally- disabled teen, who was pulled out of school in the fourth or fifth grade, was being held at the Middlesex Youth Detention Facility.
