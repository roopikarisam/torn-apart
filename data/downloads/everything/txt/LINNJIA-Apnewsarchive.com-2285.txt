MARION, Iowa (AP) â€” Police in the Cedar Rapids suburb of Marion have charged a man with first-degree murder in the death of a woman whose body was found rolled up in a blanket after being left for several days in a trailer.

Police arrested Gregory Davis after the woman's body was found Monday morning in a parked trailer. Officers found the body after being sent to a residence for a welfare check

A criminal complaint states Davis told police he'd stabbed and killed the woman four or five days before the body was found. The complaint says the woman, who had been living with Davis, had about eight stab wounds.

Davis is being held Tuesday at the Linn County jail with bond set at $2 million.

Police say they haven't identified the woman.
