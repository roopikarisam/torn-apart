Khairul Azwan Harun is 42. If elected as the new Umno Youth chief, he intends to impose an age limit for Umno Youth, effectively cutting him off from seeking reelection.

But for Azwan, known better as "Azwanbro" among his peers, that is exactly the point of doing so.

"As it stands, there is no age limit. Anyone, even a 92-year-old can become Umno Youth head," Azwan told Malaysiakini.

Should he be elected as Umno Youth head tomorrow, his successor, who will be elected in 2021, won't be a day over 40.
