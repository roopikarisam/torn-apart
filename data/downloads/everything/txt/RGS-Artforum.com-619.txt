Dennis and Debra Scholl, longtime collectors and supporters of the arts in Miami, have announced that they will donate two hundred contemporary aboriginal Australian works to the Patricia and Phillip Frost Art Museum at Florida International University, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, and the Nevada Museum of Art in Reno.


“These three institutions are really engaged in this area and with us,” Dennis Scholl, told Jane Wooldridge of the Miami Herald. “We want the work to be seen.” The gift includes pieces by painters such as Warlimpirrnga Tjapaltjari, Paddy Bedford, Gulumbu Yunipingu, and Nongirrnga Marawili. Ninety works will be given to both the Frost and the Nevada Museum. The Met will receive nineteen pieces.


The Scholls began collecting aboriginal art more than twelve years ago, when they were traveling frequently to Australia for their wine-making business. Dennis is currently the CEO or ArtCenter/South Florida, and Debra is the board chair of the nonprofit exhibition space Locust Projects. In 2012, the couple donated three hundred contemporary artworks to Miami’s Pérez Museum. “It takes a good decade to become really engaged with a genre,” Dennis said. “Then we think to find a good institutional home for the work.”
