A driver was shot in the arm as he drove on Route 24 in West Bridgewater Monday in a “car-to-car-shooting,” police said. 


The man pulled into the breakdown lane just before Exit 16 after the shooting. He was taken to Good Samaritan Hospital in Brockton, Massachusetts State Police spokesman David Procopio said. 


The suspect fled before police arrived around 6:30 p.m., officials said.
