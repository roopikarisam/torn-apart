CUMBERLAND (NEWS CENTER Maine)-- New Hampshire truck driver Luis Castro, 30, of Seabrook, New Hampshire was arrested Friday and charged with patronizing prostitution with a minor. 


Police began their investigation after the man approached a female worker at the Cumberland service plaza for sex earlier in the week. 

Police say Castro returned to the service plaza in his tractor-trailer for a prearranged meeting with who he thought was going to be a teenage girl but instead was met by State Police and arrested on scene and taken to Cumberland County Jail.
