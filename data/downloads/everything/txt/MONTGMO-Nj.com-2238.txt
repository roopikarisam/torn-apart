SOMERVILLE - A teacher's aide at East Mountain School in Montgomery Township has been arrested for sexually-assaulting a 17-year-old student, the prosecutor's office said Thursday.

Daniel E. Fowler, 35, of Princeton Pike in Lawrence, was charged with second-degree criminal sexual assault and endangering the welfare of a child, according to a news release. He was also charged with third-degree witness tampering.

East Mountain School is a private, non-profit special education school.

It was reported to township police on Aug. 30 that Fowler had sex with a female student while at the school, Somerset County Prosecutor Michael H. Robertson said. Fowler was arrested at his home on Sept. 25 with the assistance of the Lawrence Police department.

An investigation revealed Fowler used a mobile phone app to have conversations of a sexual nature with the student prior to the assault, according to the news release.

Fowler was held in the Somerset County Jail pending a detention hearing.
