Bing Concert Hall - Configuration: End Stage Map

Sponsored by:Stanford Live

In a program first presented under the auspices of Jazz at Lincoln Center, the
                           1960s are explored through the work of three prolific artists: Joni Mitchell, Abbey
                           Lincoln, and Nina Simone—all of whom have made an indelible mark in music with their
                           unique expressions of freedom. Mitchell composed and sang about the freedom of love,
                           Lincoln expressed freedom of her individuality and race through her lyricism, and
                           Simone demanded freedom politically through song.
