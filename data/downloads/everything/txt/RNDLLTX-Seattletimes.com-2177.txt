CALAIS, Maine (AP) — Police have charged five people with attempted murder after a shooting in Calais (CAH-luss), Maine.

Calais Police Chief David Randall says a man reported that two people shot at him Wednesday night near the Calais Motor Inn. The man wasn’t hurt.

He said the driver was arrested after trying to drive away when confronted by officers. He said the other occupants scattered but were later rounded up in Brookton.

The five are identified by police as 27-year-old Stephen Perkins of Baileyville, along with 21-year-old Marcos Luis Figueroa-Frias, 26-year-old Jordan Rodriguez and 20-year-old Saul Figueroa, all from New York City.

All were being booked late Thursday afternoon into the Washington County Jail. An official said it’s not known if they have attorneys.
