Nov. 22 (UPI) -- Law enforcement officers in Georgia captured a 27-year-old man who carried out his second Alabama jailbreak in less than a month earlier this week, authorities announced Wednesday.

The DeKalb County Police Department took Shane Anthony Vernon into custody "without incident" Tuesday, two days after his escape from Coosa County Jail in Rockford, Ala.


Vernon left the jail after noticing a correctional officer had failed to secure a door. He was then able to access the maintenance area through the ceiling.

After his escape, Elmore County, Ala., Sheriff Bill Franklin said Vernon broke into a home in Rockford, tied up the residents and stole a vehicle. He drove the vehicle to another part of the county and concealed it there.

He then broke into another home, waited for the resident to get home, stole a vehicle and kidnapped the resident at knifepoint, Franklin said. Authorities later found the victim safe.

The Coosa County Sheriff's Office said Vernon was awaiting extradition at the DeKalb County Jail.

Vernon first escaped the jail Oct. 29 during the booking process. He removed his restraints and ran way. He was recaptured early the next morning.
