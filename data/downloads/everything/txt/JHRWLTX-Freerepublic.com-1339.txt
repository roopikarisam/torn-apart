McLennan County will ask the state to reimburse $600,000 in costs associated with the first trial stemming from the deadly shootout in 2015 at the Twin Peaks restaurant in Waco. 


The county received about $270,000 in October 2016 from the states County Essential Services Program, primarily for costs incurred the day of the incident and shortly thereafter, including housing people at the Jack Harwell Detention Center. At the same time, the city of Waco received almost $250,000 from the U.S. Department of Justice. 


County commissioners agreed Tuesday to reapply for the state program. County Administrator Dustin Chapman said the reimbursement would cover expenses related to the trial of Jacob Carrizal, Dallas Bandidos chapter president. The county spent about $572,000 for sheriffs deputies overtime during the trial. The countys request to the state also seeks to cover juror-related expenses, Chapman said. 


The countys grant request from the state is for $571,609 in overtime costs; $81,419 for professional services, including court reporters and expert consultation; and $23,557 for other expenses, including meals, travel and security items. 


During their meeting Tuesday, commissioners also approved moving $3,500 out of the countywide contingencies line item to the jury meal and lodging line item. County Auditor Stan Chambers said the move is to cover expenses from the first trial.

There are 2 counties in Texas known to have “Duke of Hazard” /”Smokey and the Bandit” type police or worse.

1) Smith County (Tyler)
2) McLennan County (Waco)

Worse because they also just roll over for the Feds

Probably end up being 3 times that amount ...

It can be used as a “What not to do” and unofficially probably is at Baylor.

Overtime costs etc.

Gonna just have to write more tickets or build fewer stadiums.

How do you feel about having to pay for the biker gang war in Texas?


 


 Trib staff writer Cassie L. Smith’s story about McLennan County pressing the state to reimburse $600,000 in costs associated with the first Twin Peaks trial sparked plenty of outrage from readers — not over the Trib’s account but because of District Attorney Abel Reyna, subject of allegations he hijacked a murder investigation from Waco police after the 2015 biker shootout and threw 177 individuals in jail on dubious charges. He is now fighting for re-election amid county concerns about not only criminal trials but civil lawsuits piling up.
