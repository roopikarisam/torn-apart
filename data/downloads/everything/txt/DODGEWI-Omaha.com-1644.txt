An Omaha man who allegedly began choking a taxi cab driver after a wrong turn is accused of stealing the cab and driving while intoxicated.

The 38-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of theft, driving drunk and third-degree assault. He is being held on $85,000 bail in the Douglas County Jail. He must pay 10 percent, or $8,500, to be released.

The incident began about 2 a.m. Sunday when a 41-year-old cab driver picked up a fare at the Horseshoe Casino in Council Bluffs. After the cab driver made a wrong turn from West Dodge Road onto 120th Street in Omaha, the driver began following a frontage road to find a place to turn around.

The 38-year-old, who was in the back seat, became angry about the mistake and started choking the driver, according to a police report. The driver pulled over and ran from the cab, a 2004 Honda Odyssey.

A husband and wife driving near 132nd Street and West Dodge Road witnessed the driver running from the cab and heard a man yell, “I’m going to kill you,” police said. The 38-year-old then drove the cab away from the area, police said.

The witnesses picked up the driver and began tracking the cab with the aid of its GPS device. The 38-year-old was found standing by the cab outside an apartment complex near 116th Street and West Dodge Road.

Police arrived and arrested the man, who police say had a blood-alcohol level of .210, more than twice the legal limit.
