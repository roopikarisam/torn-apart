A detention hearing will be held today for a 54-year-old Newark man who may have avoided drug charges if he had paid his fare to board a PATH train in Jersey City last week.

Port Authority Police said they stopped Arion Butler, of Osbourne Avenue, after he attempted to get on a PATH train using a handicap gate on Nov. 20, the criminal complaint says.

When police stopped Butler they found he had one bag of suspected heroin, one tab of Suboxone and he gave a false name and date of birth, the complaint says.

Suboxone is a prescription drug used to treat opioid addiction. The criminal complaint did not say at which PATH station Butler was arrested.

Butler is charged with two counts of drug possession, theft of services and hindering apprehension, the complaint says.

Butler made his first appearance on the charges on Tuesday in Criminal Justice Reform Court in Jersey City via video link from Hudson County jail in Kearny.

At the hearing, the state moved to detain him through the course of his prosecution. The detention hearing is scheduled before Hudson County Superior Court Judge Paul DePascale.
