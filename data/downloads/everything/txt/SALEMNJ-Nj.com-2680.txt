A Gloucester County grand jury has indicted two men in the attempted armed robbery of a Williamstown pizza shop in September.

A man entered the Papa John's location on North Black Horse Pike on Sept. 4 and approached a woman working at the front counter, according to authorities.

He twice demanded that she hand over cash, to which she refused.

He then lifted a jacket pocket to reveal the handle of a revolver and again demanded money, police said.

When the employee refused for a third time, the man left the store.

Joseph N. Murray, of Haddonfield, and Christopher Tworzydlo, of Audubon, both 20 years old, where arrested by Haddonfield Police the next day in connection with an unrelated burglary and admitted to the Papa John's attempt, according to a criminal complaint.

The pair were indicted last week on charges including first-degree criminal attempted robbery, conspiracy and weapons charges.

Both remain in Salem County Correctional Facility, according to jail records.
