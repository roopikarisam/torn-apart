SACRAMENTO, Calif.  â€” The Latest on a serial killing and rape case in California (all times local):


10:20 p.m.
  


The man charged with being the Golden State Killer, who killed a dozen people and raped dozens of women in California decades ago, worked quietly for years in a supermarket warehouse.


Save Mart spokeswoman Victoria Castro says Joseph DeAngelo worked at the distribution center in Roseville near Sacramento for 27 years before retiring last year.


Castro says none of his workplace actions would have led the company to suspect him of a link to the crimes.
