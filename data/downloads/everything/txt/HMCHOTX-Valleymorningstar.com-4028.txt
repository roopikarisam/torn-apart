RAYMONDVILLE — Police have arrested a Lyford man in the hit-and-run accident that critically injured a cyclist.

Alfredo Garcia faces a charge of accident involving serious bodily injury, a third-degree felony, Municipal Judge Felicita Gutierrez said yesterday. Garcia’s age was not available.

Gutierrez said she issued an arrest warrant about 2:45 p.m. after investigators presented her with a probable cause affidavit.

Investigators identified Garcia as the driver of a light-colored SUV believed to be the vehicle that struck Ruben Serna, 56, as he rode a bicycle Nov. 18, Police Chief Uvaldo Zamora said earlier this week.

Serna remains in critical condition at Valley Baptist Medical Center in Harlingen, a nursing supervisor said late yesterday afternoon.

Garcia’s photograph was captured by a local Stripes convenience store camera after the accident, Zamora said.

Police, he said, matched witnesses’ descriptions of a vehicle pulling a boat believed to have struck Serna as he rode his bicycle on the shoulder of the road in front of the Otis Klar Head Start center on East FM 186 about 7 a.m. Nov. 18.

Serna, believed to be from Houston, was living in Raymondville, where he is believed to have been working at an area ranch, Zamora said.
