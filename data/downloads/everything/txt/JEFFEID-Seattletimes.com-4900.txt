BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) — A Birmingham teenager has been charged in last month’s blunt force trauma death of a toddler.

According to Jefferson County Jail records, 19-year-old Fredrich Earl Williams faces a charge of capital murder for the Sept. 26 death of 17-month-old Ta’Leah Nicole Alexander-Burke.

Al.com reports Williams was arrested at 12:10 a.m. Wednesday after being on the run since shortly after the girl’s death. He is being held without bond. Jail records did not indicate if he’s represented by an attorney.

The child’s 21-year-old mother told police she had left her daughter with her boyfriend while she ran errands. When she returned home, she found the little girl unresponsive. The child was taken by ambulance to Children’s of Alabama, where she was pronounced dead.
