The son of Republican U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore has been arrested in Alabama on a misdemeanor charge linked to allegations of illegal hunting.

Etowah County Sheriff's spokeswoman Natalie Barton tells news outlets 27-year-old Caleb Moore surrendered Monday on a charge of third-degree criminal trespass. He was accused of hunting without permission and hunting over bait last year.

Barton says Caleb Moore was released on $1,000 bond.

Moore's campaign issued a statement calling the arrest a "cheap political trick."

Caleb Moore was arrested on drug charges in 2015, but those were dropped after he entered a pre-trial diversion program.

Monday's arrest marks the ninth time the 27-year-old has been in jail, AL.com reported.

Roy Moore is facing Democrat Doug Jones in the special election for the U.S. Senate on Dec. 12. Moore is a former Alabama chief justice who's been removed from office twice.
