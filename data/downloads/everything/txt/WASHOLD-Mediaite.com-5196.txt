Democrats scored a major win against Republicans in the annual congressional baseball game Thursday, beating them 21-5 on the field of Nationals Park in Washington, D.C.

While it was the 57th time the teams faced off, it was a monumental moment for both sides in light of last year’s shooting during the Republicans’ practice session in Alexandria, VA when a gunman emerged and opened fire, striking House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-LA).

Tweeting after the game, Scalise bragged just a little, saying, “I’ve still got it.”

In the audience was House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), who was pictured with Rep. Nydia Velazquez (D-NY) as the two watched the game.

Scoring for the Democrats was Rep. Jimmy Gomez (D-CA), who tweeted out some self-praise after making it around to home base to rack up some points just before the game ended.

Missing from the game was Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT), who was claimed his participation wouldn’t be “fair” to others because he is just that good.

Senator Hatch regrets not being able to participate in the #CongressionalBaseballGame.

While he enjoys sport, he runs too fast, hits too hard, and throws too well and it simply wasn’t fair to the other athletes. pic.twitter.com/ySVE2oSj4g
