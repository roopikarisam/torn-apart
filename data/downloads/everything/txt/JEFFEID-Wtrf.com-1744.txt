Ohio Valley (WTRF) - It's been three weeks since the the Valentine's Day shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland., Florida


Since then, more than 600 copycat threats have targeted schools across the nation.


Officials confirm a rise in threats after a high-profile mass killing is nothing new, but this growing problem is no joke.


Reports show more than 130 threats were reported in the nine-day span following the shooting.


Now, a jarring 508 threats have targeted schools since.


Around seven or eight of those threats have happened right here in the Ohio Valley: targeting schools in Jefferson, Belmont and Brooke counties.


Jefferson County Sheriff Fred Abdalla said kids should know that these type of jokes will not be tolerated.


"My warning is to any student out there or anybody who makes a threat, they're going to be arrested. Period," Abdalla said.


Officials said many of these threats not only create fear in communities, but also cost police and federal agents lots of money.


Police have no choice but to take all threats with deadly seriousness.
