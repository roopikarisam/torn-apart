Suspects from  December 17, 2017 invasion of Davidson County, N.C. home of NASCAR legend Richard Childress are seen in still taken from surveillance video 

DAVIDSON COUNTY, N.C. -- Three masked men attempted to break into the home of NASCAR Legend Richard Childress Sunday night, reports CBS Greensboro, N.C. affiliate WFMY-TV. 


The Davidson County Sheriff's Office said a window was broken beside a door knob on the lower level of the home, which activated an alarm.


Investigators said Childress fired at the three, but it doesn't appear any were hit. All got away.


Sheriff David Grice said the state's "Castle Doctrine" gives people the right to defend themselves against home invasions.


Grice said Childress told him "the only reason he and his wife were here today was because of God and the Second Amendment."


Childress is offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and prosecution of the suspects.
