ELGIN, Ill. (AP) â€” The Latest on the fatal shooting of a knife-wielding woman by police in Illinois (all times local):

5:15 p.m.

Lawyers for the family of a knife-wielding woman fatally shot by a police officer along a Chicago-area interstate say her death raises questions about tactics used by the Elgin Police Department.

The attorneys issued a statement in response body-camera and dashcam video that showed events leading up to the shooting. Police released the video publicly on Thursday.

Attorney Andrew Stroth said that officers need more training on how to de-escalate situations to avoid using deadly force.

Stroth and Antonio Romanucci say in the release that they also are moving ahead with a lawsuit following the March 12 death of 34-year-old Decynthia S. Clements of Elgin.

Police say Clements' death on Interstate 90 followed an hourlong standoff with officers. An Elgin officer shot her after she got out of her vehicle while holding the knife.

Illinois State Police are investigating.
