Buffalo Weather Summary: 79 degrees

HAMBURG, NY- A busted taillight does not usually land you in jail, but that was not the case for a Buffalo man pulled over in Hamburg on Thursday.


The Erie County Sheriff's office said when Assante Huggins was pulled over for that light infraction, a computer check showed the 25-year-old has 35 active suspensions for failing to pay fines.

Huggins was taken to the Erie County Holding Center after being charged with a felony count of aggravated unlicensed operation of a motor vehicle and insufficient taillights. 


He will remain there pending his arraignment hearing in Town of Hamburg Court.
