 A Lincoln University student accused of trying to rape a woman on campus has been granted name suppression.

 The 18-year-old man was arrested a month ago and charged with assault with intent to commit rape in his hall of residence.

 The alleged attack happened a few days before his arrest.

 In the Christchurch District Court this morning, the teen's lawyer Jonathan Eaton QC told Judge Gary MacAskill the accused and the young woman were in the halls together and were in the same group of friends.

 He says the alleged attack happened after a weekly event at one of the local taverns.

 The 18-year-old kept his hands clasped in front of him and his eyes on Judge MacAskill during the appearance.

 He has left the hall and is on bail until his next appearance in December.

 The university is also investigating.
