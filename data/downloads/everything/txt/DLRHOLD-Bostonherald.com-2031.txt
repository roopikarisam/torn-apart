There’s been all kinds of speculation about the end game for Bill Belichick, Tom Brady and Robert Kraft in Foxboro. Does anyone truly know how it’s going to play out for the Patriots’ Big Three?


Fans are hoping for one more championship, perhaps even more. Whether it ends peacefully is anyone’s guess.
  


Team owner Kraft, however, has to prepare for a time when he has neither man on his payroll. Brady, 40, can’t play forever, and is nearing that time. As for Belichick, he’ll be 66 in April.
