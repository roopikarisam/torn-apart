Flasher, the trio led by Taylor Mulitz (Priests), have signed to Domino who will release the band’s debut full-length this summer. While album details haven’t been released, Flasher have shared new single “Skim Milk,” which adds just a splash of ’80s synth to their melodic indie rock style. It comes with a video, directed by Ezra Ewen, and the band say:

The themes in “Skim Milk” and its video might be described as being haunted by your own desire for belonging. We’re not bemoaning “no future, no fate”, we’re advocating for it. From getting a mortgage, to going to college, to crafting public policy, folks are always telling you to think of your future, to make choices in the name of some future. But most folks don’t have the privilege to live outside the present. This kind of future tense, aspirational bullshit means being held hostage by a future that’s already abandoned you. We’d rather escape to something new and unknown than hold out for a good life that hates us and expects us to make lemonade out of miserableness. Instead of holding out and hanging on, we’re here to tell you (and ourselves) – “go.”

Watch the “Skim Milk” video below.

Flasher will be on tour later this year with The Breeders and Ought, but before that they’ll head to Austin for SXSW including the first day of BrooklynVegan and Margin Walker’s three-day Lost Weekend 2 (Thursday, March 15 at Cheer Up Charlies). Our day parties are free (RSVP) and we’ll be announcing the lineups for all three very soon.

Updated Flasher tour dates are listed below.
