SOUTH CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) â€” West Virginia authorities are still searching for an inmate who wasn't discovered missing until nearly two days after he escaped from the Charleston jail.

The Department of Military and Public Safety says 44-year-old Todd Wayne Boyes of Caldwell, Ohio, escaped around 5 a.m. Wednesday, but the South Central Regional Jail staff didn't notice until Thursday evening.

A review of the facility's jail's security video showed Boyes leaving the facility the previous morning.

Boyes was scheduled to be sentenced Friday to up to 20 years in prison on charges including fleeing and possession of a stolen car.


He was initially charged with attempted murder after Charleston police Cpl. Renee Smith was hurt during a pursuit to arrest him, but the charge was dropped in a September plea deal.

According to investigators, the 5-foot-6, 220-pound Boyes obtained khaki pants and a dark green or grey jacket he wore to escape by posing as a civilian or jail trusty.

Three end-of-shift head counts failed to alert jail staff to his disappearance.
