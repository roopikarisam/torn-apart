HILLSBOROUGH COUNTY, Fla. (WFLA)  A Hillsborough County man is charged with murdering his step-son, then forcing the boys brothers to sleep in the same bed with the body all night. 


31-year-old Jack Junior Montgomery is being held at the county jail on $870-thousand dollars bond. He is accused of repeatedly punching and kicking 7-year-old Brice Russell. 


Montgomery told investigators he disciplined the child after Brice got out of bed to get a cookie.

I hope that POS gets executed.

Give me five minutes alone first.

I hope that POS gets executed.

Me too...........preferably in prison by some real mean vermin that will have no mercy.

Yet another mama’s boyfriend story. But the media and our cultural elites still insist that the real problem in America is the people who believe in 2-married-parent families.

They should auction chances to be a juror in trials for some of these monsters. The proceeds could go to the loved ones left behind for years of therapy they will need.

Some people just need killin’................but only after Being introduced to a baseball bat with rusty spikes..............

I wonder what SSRI’s he was taking?

There was a time when he would have been taken care of.

I’m not feeling anger toward the man, but I do think this justifies execution.

It would be interesting to determine what in his upbringing caused him to never leave his infantile raw narcissistic state.

No more dangerous place for a child but in a home where the father ISN'T there! STAY MARRIED WOMEN for your KIDS sake!


Just take the POS out back of the jail and put 5 in his head. I’ll do it if no one else will.

Step dad, mama working double shifts and living in a “hotel”. Did he marry her for a paycheck? Where’s bio dad/s? Did the murderer work?

Completely evil.

You’re a better person than I. I feel anger when i read things like this.

Mess with kids or elderly folks, and i find myself in a highly un-Christian mode. Gimme 5 minutes with this guy.

Most dangerous thing a child will ever hear: ‘Hey kids, come meet Mommy’s my new boyfriend’

Im not feeling anger toward the man, but I do think this justifies execution.

You’re not feeling anger towards some sub-human who beat a little kid to death? Really?

And, to correct madprof98, it’s not “another mama’s boyfriend story.” Evidently the child’s mother actually married this monster.

 This is heartbreaking.


 I have heard of very similar before.


Or do like my mother did after my father bailed on us and wait to date until after I had gone to college.

Was he actually the step-dad, or is ‘step-dad’ just the press’s generic term for mom’s boyfriend? You know, like ‘teens’ or ‘youths’.
