UPDATE: Prosecutor files motion to dismiss OVI case against Shawnee Hills police chief


---


ORIGINAL STORY:


Shawnee Hills police chief Russell Baron was arrested Tuesday night and charged with OVI, according to the Delaware County Sheriff’s Office.


The sheriff’s office said they pulled Baron over for a traffic stop near Dublin Road and Home Road in Concord Township around 10:30 p.m.


Baron’s attorney told 10TV his client cooperated with the sheriff’s office and Baron believes he did nothing wrong.


Baron agreed to a breathalyzer test, his attorney said.


His attorney shared a copy of the ticket with 10TV, and it shows Baron recorded a blood alcohol level of .04.


The ticket also shows Baron is accused of having an obstructed license plate.


After the arrest, the sheriff’s office said Baron was issued a summons to go to court.  He was not booked into the jail.


According to the village of Shawnee Hills website, Baron has been a member of the Shawnee Hills Police Department since 2011.


He was promoted to chief in 2015 after overseeing patrol operations and serving as the liaison for their community policing programs.
