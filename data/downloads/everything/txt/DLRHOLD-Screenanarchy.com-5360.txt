After its first edition at the Timberline Hotel in Oregon, The Overlook Film Festival has moved to the haunted city of New Orleans, Louisiana. This year's festival, which runs from April 19th to April 22nd, is packed with the kind of clever content that has put Overlook on the genre map, including a wide swath of horror features and shorts as well as live experiential events, virtual reality installations podcasts and much more. The full lineup is provided below.
