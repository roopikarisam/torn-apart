    Valley Baptist honors organ donors with Hero wall

During a heartfelt ceremony Friday morning at Valley Baptist Medical Center-Brownsville, Harlingen resident Jorge Garcia told a group of families whose loved ones have died and donated organs how much it meant to him when he received a kidney in 2013.

“I’ve gone through a lot and on May 25, I will go on my fifth year on this new kidney,” Garcia said. “It has given me that second chance.”

Garcia, 68, a Marine and Vietnam veteran, said that in 2004, while working as an events supervisor at the then-University of Texas at Brownsville, he noticed he became so weak that he couldn’t lift a chair.

After a trip to the doctor, he learned his kidney was not properly working and, after a few more trips, his doctors told him that sometime in his past, he contracted Hepatitis C during a blood transfusion.

In order to get a kidney, the donor also would have to have had Hepatitis C for the transplant to work.

“For me to get somebody who matched was a blessing to me,” Garcia said, tearing up, as his wife stood nearby, supporting the veteran.

Dr. Tina Briones, a registered nurse who is vice president at Valley Baptist Medical Center-Harlingen, fought back tears as she told the group how her son died of cancer 15 years ago at the age of 27.

At the time of her child’s death, people with cancer could not donate organs, which was something her son wanted to do. So she and her husband promised their son that they would dedicate their life to promoting organ donation.

“You’re the ones who gave your loved one so others can have a better life,” she told the families.

Briones said there is no harder decision, knowing that in order to bring life to someone else, a loved one has to die.

“I can’t think of anything greater,” Briones said.

Leslie Bingham, chief executive officer at Valley Baptist Medical Center-Brownsville, described the ceremony as bittersweet.

“I hope this ceremony is as meaningful for you as it is for us,” Bingham told the families.

Ten years ago, Bingham said, Texas was the state with the slowest growing number of organ donors.

“Today, Texas is the second largest,” Bingham said.

At the close of the ceremony, Joe Perez, vice president of pastoral services, presented certificates to the families of organ donors and Marisa Aguilar, chief operating officer, officiated the Donate Life Flag Raising at the hospital’s entrance before the unveiling of the Wall of Heroes in the Stillman Lobby.

The Wall of Heroes honors those who have saved and impacted lives through the willingness and courage to give their loved ones’ organs.

April is the National Donate Life Month, during which activities to encourage Americans to register as organ, eye and tissue donors are held and to celebrate those who have passed on but saved lives through the gift of donation.
