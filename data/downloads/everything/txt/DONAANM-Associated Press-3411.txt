LAS CRUCES, N.M. (AP) â€” The former longtime director of the Dona Ana County Detention Center has pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor marijuana possession charge.

The Las Cruces Sun News reports that three other marijuana possession charges against Chris Barela were dismissed as part of the June 13 plea deal.

Under the plea, Barela's marijuana possession charge will be dismissed and no conviction will appear on his record if he successfully completes his probation.


Authorities launched an investigation of Barela after receiving a tip that he was regularly buying marijuana.

Detectives set up a sting in which Barela allegedly bought marijuana from undercover operatives.

Barela was placed on leave from the detention center and resigned in September.

He had been the head of the jail since December 2005.
