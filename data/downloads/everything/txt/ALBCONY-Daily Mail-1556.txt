Andy Sartiano was charged with aggravated cruelty to an animal having been taken into custody on Wednesday

A former director of an animal sanctuary has been arrested for allegedly telling an employee to euthanize a cat by breaking its neck.


Andy Sartiano was charged with aggravated cruelty to an animal having been taken into custody on Wednesday. 


Both she and the employee were fired as a result of the callous act at the Albany Humane Society in Georgia.


As police consider whether or not to bring further charges, Sartiano was held at Dougherty County Jail.


The Albany Humane Society board of directors president Dianne Barlow told WALB the ex-chief had been fired because she 'did not perform her duties'.


Putting a cat down by breaking its neck falls way outside the sanctuary's protocol. 


The society states on its website its mission is to be the last hope for the 4,000 to 5,000 animals they take care of a year. 


A statement reads: 'The Albany Humane Society is dedicated to the welfare of animals who cannot speak for themselves.If we are to continue meeting the needs of hungry, sick and homeless animals, we will need your help. 


'We presently provide housing for the animals of Albany and Dougherty County. 


'We accept strays turned in by concerned citizens, as well as pets surrendered by their owners.


Our goals are to reduce pet overpopulation, provide pet education and provide compassionate care for unwanted animals.'
