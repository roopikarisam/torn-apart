PITTSFIELD, Mass. (AP) — Nurses at one Massachusetts hospital have set a date for a one-day strike, while another hospital’s nurses have voted to authorize a strike if necessary.

The Berkshire Eagle reports registered nurses at Pittsfield’s Berkshire Medical Center announced Thursday they will strike Feb. 27 unless contract negotiations progress.

The nurses allege the hospital is understaffed, affecting patient safety.

They held a one-day walkout in October. Hospital officials say a second strike will cost up to $4 million.

Baystate Franklin Medical Center nurses in Greenfield voted Thursday to authorize a strike. No date was set.

Baystate nurses are concerned with staffing levels and health insurance options. They held a one-day strike last June.

A spokeswoman says the hospital “remains focused on a good-faith effort to reach a fair conclusion to contract negotiations.”
