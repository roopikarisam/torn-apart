BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) â€” A daycare owner accused of embezzling thousands of dollars from her previous church facility has been released from an Alabama jail after posting $11,000 bond.

AL.com reports jail records say Faith Jones was booked Monday afternoon into the Jefferson County Jail before being released hours later.

On Sunday, Birmingham police announced a first-degree theft of property charge against Jones, who was the director of a church daycare at the time of the alleged crime.


Police Sgt. Bryan Shelton says payments from the State of Alabama Childcare Resources meant for the daycare were instead deposited into Jones' personal account. Shelton says the daycare was forced to close because of Jones' embezzlement.

Jones is accused of embezzling more than $21,000 in less than a year. It's unclear if she has an attorney.
