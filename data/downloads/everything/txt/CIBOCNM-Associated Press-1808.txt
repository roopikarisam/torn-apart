ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) â€” Several prominent New Mexico Democrats say they will make charitable donations in the amounts of campaign contributions they received from two private prison companies amid debate over the Trump administration's child separation policy and other immigration-related issues.

The Albuquerque Journal reports the companies are GEO Group Inc. and CoreCivic, which operate immigrant detention centers and private correctional facilities across the country.


Spokesmen for the two companies say they do not operate facilities for unaccompanied minors, and that their organizations do not advocate for or against immigration enforcement or detention policies.

GEO Group operates several private prisons and related facilities in New Mexico, and CoreCivic runs a private prison and a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement detention center in Cibola County.

Share prices of both GEO Group and CoreCivic have risen in response to Trump administration immigration policies.
