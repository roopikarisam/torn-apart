HOLLY SPRINGS, Miss. (AP) â€” Police are searching parts of two states for a man charged with three murders who escaped a northwest Mississippi jail.


WREG-TV reports police searched a house in Memphis, Tennessee, Monday looking for Antoine Adams.

Jailed in Holly Springs, Mississippi, Adams stuffed pillows under the blankets on his bed to make it look like he was asleep, pushed open a Plexiglas window, and crawled under a fence to freedom early Sunday.


Adams, 27, is accused of killing a man and leaving him in a rural Mississippi ditch late last year. He also faces two murder charges in Memphis. Adams was arrested in August in Texas and brought to Mississippi.

Marshall County Sheriff Kenny Dickerson says the county was already covering the windows with steel, and was supposed to start Monday on the section including Adams' cell.

"It's in the process of already being done," Dickerson said. "We just hadn't gotten to that particular area where he got out."

Criminal investigator Kelly McMillen told WHBQ-TV that Adams' escape was caught on camera, and Dickerson said he'll look to fire the jailer who missed seeing the escape on camera.

"Had that jailer or jailers been watching and doing what they're paid for, they would have caught it," Dickerson told WMC-TV.

Residents across the street from the jail expressed alarm.

"You should have had windows secured anyway at all times with a jail," said Helen Kizer. She said an inmate escaped and crossed her property several years ago.
