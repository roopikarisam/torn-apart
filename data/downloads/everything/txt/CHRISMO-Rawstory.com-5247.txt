A longtime teacher at an Orlando Christian day school has been taken into custody and charged with child abuse for allegedly stomping on a 5-year-old under her care because he failed to “speak with Jesus” during a time-out for acting up.


According to the Miami Herald, Kingsway Christian Academy teacher Diane Williams has been charged with child abuse and released from Orange County Jail on $1,000 bond after being taken into custody last week.


The arrest report notes that another teacher at Kingsway noticed a bruise on the foot of the 5-year-old and asked what happened, only to be told that he had been sent by Williams to go “sit on the bench and talk to Jesus,” in an isolated “private prayer room” for misbehaving. He explained that he never saw Jesus, which infuriated Williams.


“When [Williams] entered the room a few minutes later, the teacher stomped on the student’s foot, leaving a bruise,” the arrest affidavit stated.


According to police, surveillance video taken at the school “completely” corroborated the student’s version of the stomping incident.


In a statement to parents, Kingsway Christian Academy officials said Williams has been let go while also praising her years of service to the school, saying: “We love our children. They are precious to us and precious to God. Mrs. Williams is an amazing teacher and loved by her hundreds of students from over the years, their parents and grandparents.”


The report notes that Williams is also under investigation by the Department of Children and Families.
