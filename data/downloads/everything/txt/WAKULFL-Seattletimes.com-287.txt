CRAWFORDVILLE, Fla. (AP) — Authorities in Florida say they’re searching for three county jail inmates who managed to escape.

 The Tallahassee Democrat reports that the escape occurred early Friday morning at the Wakulla County jail.

The sheriff’s office says Joel Cooper, Donald Cotterman and Casey Brandon managed to break through the ceiling of the facility’s law library and then make their way to freedom across the building’s roof.

The sheriff’s office and five other agencies were searching a heavily wooded area around the jail.

The suspects were wearing grey or white sweats and long johns. Authorities are telling residents not to approach the inmates but to immediately call the sheriff’s office if they’re spotted.
