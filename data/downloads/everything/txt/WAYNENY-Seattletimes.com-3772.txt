LILLINGTON, N.C. (AP) — An inmate has died after he was found unresponsive in a North Carolina jail cell.

Harnett County Sheriff Wayne Coats said in a news release that 52-year-old Kevin Thomas McWhinnie of Fayetteville was found around 1:30 p.m. Saturday at the jail in Lillington.

The sheriff’s office said McWhinnie was taken to Central Harnett Hospital where he was pronounced dead about an hour later.

He had been arrested last Thursday on charges of violating a domestic violence protection order.

The sheriff said the State Bureau Of Investigation had been asked to investigate the death.
