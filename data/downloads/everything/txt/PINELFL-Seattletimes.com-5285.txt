TAMPA, Fla. (AP) — Four Florida deputies have been suspended for allegedly neglecting their duties during Hurricane Irma.

According to an investigation by the Pinellas County Sheriff’s Office, one deputy told supervisors he wasn’t reporting for duty and was aware of the consequences, another evacuated instead of reporting for duty at the jail, another showed up for an hour but then went home. Sheriff Bob Gualtieri said they all had family at home and didn’t make arrangements beforehand.

Three deputies will receive 40 hours without pay with part of the punishment delayed if they stay out of trouble. Two were demoted from narcotics detectives to patrol duties. The fourth was given 16 hours without pay.

Gualtieri said the officers stepped out “when everyone else was stepping up.”

The Tampa Bay Times report four Largo city employees lost their jobs for similar reasons in September.
