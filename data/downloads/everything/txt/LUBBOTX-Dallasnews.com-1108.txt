A pistol-wielding Lubbock man intent on getting cigarettes entered a 7-Eleven store three times, but it was the third time he won't soon forget.

That's because the altercation that erupted after Treshun Bates, 21, refused to leave the premises ended with the clerk throwing Bates through the store's front window.

As the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported, the incident took place around 6 p.m. Wednesday, when Bates walked into the store and asked for cigarettes but was unable to show any ID proving he was at least 18 years old.


When the clerk declined to sell him the cigarettes, Bates left. He returned to the store with a second person, who attempted to buy the cigarettes as Bates stood behind him.


Again, the clerk refused to conduct the transaction, explaining that the two could not prove that Bates was of age.


This made Bates "extremely irate," the clerk told police.


Bates then raised his jacket to display a pistol tucked into his pants. "I can get whatever I want," he said.

The clerk then emerged from behind the counter and attempted to get Bates to leave, finally pushing him out the front door.


That's when Bates pulled out the gun and began to beat the clerk with it, police said.


The clerk responded by grabbing Bates, picking him up and throwing him through the front window of the store, according to police accounts. He then went back inside and held Bates in a headlock where he had landed, which was strewn with blood and shattered glass.


Thinking police were near, the clerk released Bates and he escaped, blood gushing from his left arm as he fled.


According to the police report, officers found him in an apartment unit nearby and asked whether he needed medical assistance.


"He stated he did because he was thrown through the window at 7-11," the report said.

Bates has been charged with aggravated robbery and is being held at the Lubbock County Detention Center on $50,000 bond
