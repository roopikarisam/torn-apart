SEATTLE -- An hours-long standoff in the 11200 block of Fremont Avenue North ended Saturday morning after police wounded the suspect.


Police say the incident began when a 66-year-old man fired a shot and threatened a North Seattle neighbor about 9:30 p.m. Friday and ended when a SWAT officer opened fire Saturday morning.


The suspect was taken to Harborview Medical Center with what are described as non-life-threatening wounds.





Officers arrived after the shot was fired at the neighbor, and the man barricaded himself in a house. Police spent several hours trying to negotiate with him and asked residents in neighboring houses to leave while the situation unfolded, according to police. 


Police say about 4:30 a.m. Saturday the man looked out of a door or window, then fired several times with a shotgun at a police SWAT vehicle, hitting it. A SWAT officer then returned fire and wounded the man in the lower half of his body, police said. The  man retreated into the house, but surrendered an hour later.


No officers were hurt during the incident. 


The man will be booked into King County jail once he is released from the hospital, according to police. 


Detectives are investigating the events that led up to the shooting, according to police. The officer who shot the man will be placed on paid administrative leave during the investigation, which is department protocol.
