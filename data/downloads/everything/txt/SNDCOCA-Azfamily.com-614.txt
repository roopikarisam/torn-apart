Police believe the couple helped Madeline and her son disappear so Madeline could avoid co-parenting. 


The baby's father, Jacob Gouchenour, says a judge had granted dual parental custody to him and his ex-wife Madeline in June of this year. 


Madeline and William went missing the next day.


Police say Madeline is facing a charge of custodial interference for keeping William from his father.


Gouchenour was granted sole custody during this incident and will be reunited with his son.
