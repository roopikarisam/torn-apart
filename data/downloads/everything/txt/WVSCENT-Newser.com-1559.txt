                                        West Virginia troopers are searching for a jail inmate who was not discovered missing until nearly two days after he escaped, the AP reports. State police First Sgt. JT Findley tells news outlets that 43-year-old Todd Boyes of Caldwell, Ohio, escaped on Wednesday around 5am. South Central Regional Jail staff noticed Boyes was gone on Friday around 12:30am.
                                    


                                        


 Boyes was scheduled to be sentenced Friday to up to 20 years in prison on charges including fleeing and possession of a stolen car. Boyes was initially charged with attempted murder after Charleston police Cpl. Renee Smith was hurt during a pursuit to arrest him, but the charge was dropped in a September plea deal. Troopers say the search isn't concentrated on a specific area, and they don't have solid leads.
