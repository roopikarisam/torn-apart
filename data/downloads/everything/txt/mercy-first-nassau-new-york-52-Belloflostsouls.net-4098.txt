Heroes never die! And with the new Mercy statue from Blizzard, you can make sure she will always be watching over you.



Dr. Angela Ziegler is better known by her callsign “Mercy” in the first person shooter, Overwatch.



She helped to forge the international task force into the peacekeeping strength that it was at its peak.  Even after the fall of Overwatch, she remained a brilliant scientist and a staunch advocate for peace, even though her Caduceus Blaster does crazy amounts of damage and when she uses Valkyrie she’s impossible to hit unless you use Tactical Visor. Which you now basically have to save just for that, because you can’t trust Zenyatta to keep Discord Orb on her and McCree is dealing with Tracer harassing your backline.

… … Sorry, what was I talking about?



Oh, right. Sorry.

The Mercy statue stands 13.75″ from floor to head and is hand painted with excellent detailing on the face and insignias.







You can pick up the Mercy statue at the official Blizzard store.
