Omaha fire investigators are asking for the public’s help in locating a man accused of helping start a fire in a trailer home.

Fire officials say they consider Joshua McDermott, 33 of Omaha, to be dangerous, and they ask that people who know where he is to call 911. His last known address is 5414 S. 16th St., officials said, but family members have told authorities that he has not been seen at that residence for some time.

Fire investigators say McDermott helped another man start a fire at a trailer south of 136th and L Streets before 6 a.m. Feb. 26. Four people were in the trailer at the time of the fire. They were forced to escape from the rear of the trailer by breaking a window and climbing out.

All four people were taken to the hospital for treatment of smoke inhalation and cuts from broken glass.

The $20,000 structure and $10,000 in contents were lost in the fire, officials said.

Council Bluffs fire investigators, Council Bluffs police and Omaha fire investigators found another man suspected of starting the fire about six hours after the fire call. He is in the Pottawattamie County Jail on unrelated charges and is awaiting extradition to Omaha in connection with this case.

McDermott’s name came up in the subsequent investigation, officials said. He initially agreed to turn himself in but has not been seen since.

People with information about McDermott are asked to call the arson hotline at 402-444-FIRE or Crime Stoppers at 402-444-STOP.




The fire south of 136th and L Streets was reported around 5:55 a.m. Monday, Douglas County 911 dispatchers said.
