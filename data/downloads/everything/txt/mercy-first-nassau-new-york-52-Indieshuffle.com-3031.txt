LA rockers The Rare Occasions have been churning out music since 2013 without dropping a major release. That's all changed this week with the quartet announcing their long awaited debut album Into The Shallows and dropping the LP's second single "Mercy Mercy."


Combining garage rock riffs with an indie sensibility and infectious hook, "Mercy Mercy" is a brilliant slice of pop ideal for first time listeners. It's a great song that tells you everything you need to know about what The Rare Occasions are about.


There's a bit of early Foals about this one, with the math-rock like guitar work and multiple tempo changes giving the track an interesting scope. 


This is an exciting release from The Rare Occasions and one that makes me think Into The Shallows will be a sleeper hit of 2018. 


Into The Shallows is set for release May 25.
