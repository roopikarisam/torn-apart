                                        A body discovered at the home of New York Giants cornerback Janoris Jenkins has led to a manslaughter charge for his brother. William Jenkins, released from a New Jersey prison in 2016 after serving time for drug charges, was arrested in New York around 2am Tuesday; he had violated his parole by leaving the state. Eight hours later, authorities received a 911 call and responded to the Fair Lawn home of Janoris Jenkins, 10 miles north of MetLife Stadium, where they found the body of 25-year-old Roosevelt Rene. Described as a family friend and music producer working under the name Trypps Beatz, Rene had been living at the home while the NFLer was in his native Florida, having wrapped up a Giants minicamp two weeks ago, per ESPN and NJ.com.
                                    


                                        Though authorities asked a neighbor if they'd heard gunshots, per WABC, NFL Network's Mike Garafolo reports police are investigating the death as a "possible strangulation/suffocation." Rene's body was reportedly found in the basement of the home by a worker, according to TMZ. William Jenkins, who also lived at his brother's home, was charged Wednesday with aggravated manslaughter and is being held at Ontario County Jail in New York. Janoris Jenkins—a 2017 Pro Bowl starter who signed a five-year, $62.5 million contract with the Giants in 2016, per the AP—remains in Florida, with the Giants organization saying it is "aware of and monitoring the situation."
