MINOT, N.D. (AP) — A judge says a North Dakota man originally charged with attempted murder for an assault on a county deputy must serve more than six years in prison.

The Minot Daily News reports that 33-year-old Michael Marion, of Dunseith, pleaded guilty Monday to numerous felony charges, including aggravated assault, attempting to disarm an officer, and possession with intent to deliver methamphetamine.

Authorities say Marion resisted arrest after a vehicle pursuit in February 2017. They say Marion reached for Deputy Keith Benning’s gun and tried to point it toward the officer, saying “he could not go back to jail.” The gun allegedly discharged twice during the scuffle.

Benning wasn’t shot, but did suffer multiple injuries from the scuffle, including three broken ribs. He was also struck over his eye with brass knuckles.
