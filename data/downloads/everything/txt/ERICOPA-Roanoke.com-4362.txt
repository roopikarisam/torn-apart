ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) â€” More than $3 million is being allocated to 17 county jails across New York to treat heroin- and opioid-addicted inmates.


Republican state Sens. George Amedore of the Mohawk Valley, Fred Akshar of Binghamton and Chris Jacobs of the Buffalo area announced Tuesday that the jails will split $3.75 million for substance use disorder treatment and transition services.


Allotments range from $58,000 for the Wayne County Jail to $400,000 for the jails in Broome, Erie, Niagara and Schenectady counties.


The jails in Albany, Suffolk, Nassau, Monroe and Oneida counties will each receive $200,000. Jails in Clinton, Jefferson, Putnam, Ontario, Columbia, Tioga and Tompkins counties will get $156,000 each.


The senators say jail-based addiction services are essential to battling the heroin and opioid epidemic.
