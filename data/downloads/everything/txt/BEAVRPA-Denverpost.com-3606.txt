Nearly 70 Morgan County Jail inmates were bused to jails in Washington and Logan Counties early New Year’s Day after a pipe burst, cutting off water to the jail, officials say.

The fire alarm sounded at 6:30 a.m., and deputies soon found water pouring from the ceiling in several locations in the county’s justice center, according to Morgan County Sheriff Jim Crone. 

A 1½-inch pipe was showering the building with up to 36 gallons a minute. Shortly afterward a main water line in the 800 block of East Beaver Street failedl, and water burst through the street outside the jail, Crone said in a news release.

Because there was no water to the jail’s bathrooms and kitchen, Crone ordered an evacuation. Sixty-eight handcuffed inmates were taken in vans and three Fort Morgan School District buses to the two jails, Crone said.

Forty law enforcement officers escorted the inmates in long caravans, he said.
