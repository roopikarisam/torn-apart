KENT, Wash. (AP) — A 24-year-old Kent woman is being held in jail after her infant son was found dead last week.

Kent Police Cmdr. Jarod Kasner says investigators believe the woman left her baby on a sleeping bag alone for "a significant amount of time." When she returned, the baby was face down and not breathing.

KOMO reported Sunday that detectives believe the mother was reckless in caring for her infant, which resulted in the boy's death.

Officers found the boy unresponsive Tuesday night. He was 2 ½ months old but had been born six weeks premature and spent the first month in the hospital.

Kasner says the mother was booked into jail on Friday.
