SOUTH CHARLESTON, W.Va. (AP) — A West Virginia man has been arrested after police found two young children alone in a car at a Walmart.

Media outlets report 31-year-old Matthew Stover of Lizemores was charged with child neglect creating risk of injury, receiving and transferring stolen property and obstructing.

According to a criminal complaint, police Wednesday found a 3-year-old boy wearing shorts, a jacket with no shirt underneath and no shoes or socks. A 1-year-old girl smelled strongly of urine. She was taken to a hospital for treatment of a severe rash.

Police discovered the car’s license plate was stolen and a window was missing. The complaint says the man showed police fake identification after he left the store in South Charleston. The children were later released to their mother.

Stover is being held at the South Central Regional Jail.
