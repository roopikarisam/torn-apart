ORANGE COUNTY, Calif., Feb. 14, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- VITAS Healthcare, the nation's leading provider of end-of-life care, has opened its first dedicated hospital-based inpatient suites in Orange County at Chapman Global Medical Center, where together, they will provide high quality care for terminally ill patients with complex symptoms.

VITAS patients will receive the highest quality of care from Chapman Hospital staff under the direction and supervision of the VITAS' interdisciplinary team of dedicated physicians, nurses, social workers and chaplains attending to the medical, emotional, social and spiritual needs of patients and their families. 

"We are very happy to partner with VITAS Healthcare and their expert hospice and palliative care team to provide these important and much-needed services," said Ron Galonsky, Chief Executive Officer at Chapman Global Medical Center.
