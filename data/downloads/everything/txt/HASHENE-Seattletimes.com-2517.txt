AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) â€” Georgia prison officials are investigating the death of an inmate at Augusta State Medical Prison.

The Department of Corrections said in a news release Tuesday that a guard found 39-year-old Montra Moss unresponsive at 12:30 a.m. Monday. Prison medical staff tried to revive him, but he was pronounced dead at 1:08 a.m.

The department says it is investigating the death, which is standard procedure.

Moss was sentenced in 2017 for trafficking cocaine and possessing marijuana in Hall County.

This is the fourth death in Georgia prison in just over a week.

Prison officials said last week that two inmates apparently committed suicide on Oct. 29, one at Phillips State Prison in Buford and the other at Wilcox State Prison in Abbeville. Another inmate died Oct. 31 at Hancock State Prison.
