CHEEKTOWAGA, N.Y. (AP) — Authorities say the man accused of spraying the entrance of a suburban Buffalo retails store with gunfire had requested a job application before he began shooting.

Erie County prosecutors say 29-year-old Travis Green walked into a Dollar General store Tuesday afternoon and requested a job application. Officials say he became irate, left the store and got a pump-action AR-15-style rifle from his car.

Police say he then fired more than 20 rounds at the store from the outside, shattering the entrance’s glass door and windows. A 53-year-old man outside the store at the time was wounded in the shoulder.

The owner of a nearby business drove his car into Green when he paused in between firing. Green then fled on foot but was caught nearby by police.

He’s being held in jail without bail.
