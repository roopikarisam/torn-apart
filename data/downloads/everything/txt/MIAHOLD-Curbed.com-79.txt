A groundbreaking ceremony was held May 9 in District 12 for a new linear park, Miami-Dade Parks, Recreation and Open Spaces Department reports.

The park will benefit Miami neighborhoods such as Doral, Hialeah, Hialeah Gardens, Medley, Sweetwater, and Virginia Gardens.

The ceremony’s attendees included Commissioner Jose “Pepe” Diaz, personnel from Miami-Dade Parks, Recreation and Open Spaces Department, and the public.

The under construction park, named FPL Linear Park &amp; Trail, will be built on an underused green space at Southwest 2nd Street between 136 Court and 136 Place.

The revised plan would see the controversial arena replace Melreese Country Club.

The 31-story combination hotel and condo building is slated to break ground later this year.

The conceptual plan calls for a mix of retail, office, residential, and hospitality uses.

The V12-powered Italian thoroughbred certainly makes for a unique interior accent piece.

The sale of the sprawling 13-bedroom home set a new record for Cocoplum.

The development is the first U.S. building by the renowned Italian architect Antonio Citterio.
