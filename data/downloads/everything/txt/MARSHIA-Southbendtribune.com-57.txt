A former University of Notre Dame wide receiver was arrested once again and is now being held in jail until his next hearing.

Kevin Stepherson was arrested Tuesday when arriving for a violation of probation hearing in Fulton County. Stepherson cannot post bond while he awaits his Feb. 6 hearing.

The former Irish football player was first arrested in August when he and four teammates were pulled over in Fulton County. Stepherson was charged with possession of marijuana, but took a plea agreement to have the charges removed if he stayed out of trouble for one year.

But in December, he was pulled over in Marshall County and again charged with possession of marijuana. He was also charged with speeding and driving without a valid driver's license. He was arrested again at Macy's in Mishawaka for reportedly trying to shoplift a pair of Nautica sweatpants. He was charged with conversion in St. Joseph County.

Then last week he was arrested in Whitley County, again for possession of marijuana. 

A judge will now decide to continue Stepherson's discharge conditions, put him on probation or sentence him on the marijuana charge, according to the Fulton County Prosecutor's Office.
