GRAND ISLAND, Neb. (AP) — Authorities say a woman released from the Hall County Jail so she could report to her job failed to return to the jail after her shift.

Television station KSNB reports that the sheriff’s office is looking for 26-year-old Natalia Ramos, of Grand Island. The office says Ramos failed to return from work release on Wednesday.

Ramos was sentenced to nine months in jail on Jan. 10 for a misdemeanor theft conviction and had been granted work release on Monday to work at a Grand Island restaurant.

Officials say she is not considered dangerous, but asks anyone who sees her to call 911.
