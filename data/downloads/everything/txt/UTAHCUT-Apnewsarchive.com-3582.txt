AMERICAN FALLS, Idaho (AP) â€” A 25-year-old Utah man being sought by police following the finding of a body in northern Utah has been taken into custody in southeastern Idaho.

The Power County Sheriff's Office in Idaho says deputies arrested Chay Blair on suspicion of felony eluding on Wednesday following a police pursuit.

Authorities say the chase ended when Blair drove over spike strips.

Blair was being held in the Power County Jail. The county's prosecuting attorney didn't immediately return a call from The Associated Press.
