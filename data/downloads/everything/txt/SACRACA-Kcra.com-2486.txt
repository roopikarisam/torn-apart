A Sacramento man was accused of causing a five-car crash that killed four people and injured six others Saturday, the California Highway Patrol–Oakland said.





Fred Lowe was booked into the Contra Costa County Jail. It is unclear what Lowe is being charged with. 


The crash happened about 8 p.m. on Highway 80 in San Pablo when officers said Lowe was driving eastbound and crashed into another car, CHP–Oakland said. Officers said the second car flipped over and landed in the westbound lanes and collided with three other cars.


Four passengers in the second car that flipped over were killed, while the driver and other people injured, including a child, were taken to the hospital, CHP-Oakland confirmed to KCRA 3 affiliate NBC Bay Area.


Officers said Lowe left the crash scene, but was later found by authorities.


No other details were released.


Stay with KCRA 3 for the latest.
