Rep. Maxine Waters, a leader in the resist-Trump movement, recently told a New York audience that she will take out the president, a video posted online last week shows. 


Wow, what a moving evening this is, Waters is heard saying in the video of an Oct. 13 event at the Ali Forney Center in New York City. 


Im sitting here listening, watching, absorbing, thinking about Ali even though I never met him. And with this kind of inspiration, I will go and take Trump out tonight, the California Democrat said as the crowd cheered.

Just imagining the double-standard...as we all are. A genuine shame that it’s all to common.

“The actions of the past few weeks have caused me to trimble...I woke up in the middle of the night with flashes of the struggles of my African ancestors for justice.”

“Let history record: I, Maxine Waters, member of Congress, representing the 35th Congessional District of the United States of America, is of sound mind, excellent health, and a clear conscience.”

Some classic Maxine Waters quotes from the Judiciary Committee impeachment hearings in 1998.

 She is nuts. 


 Most of the hard core proglib comrats are. 


 .


The cheers should have been signal to release VX.

Sounds like a threat on the President from a kooky race-baiter and liar.

I hope Waters and Wilson are part of the Kamala Harris campaign for President

I would LOVE to see her run for POTUS, especially with that goofy, dumb-azz Lewis as her running mate. Put your money where you mouth is, MaxiPad. Run, Maxi...Run!!!!

“She is beyond despicable. “

You’ve just described democrats.

It’s a good thing (for Maxine) that nobody pays any attention to her—except for an occasional laugh.

Karma is delayed but it is coming for Mad arrogant Maxine.. Oh yes it is.

 The Left (to be clear, "the enemy within") are "disgusting despicables".








Keep talkin’ Mad Max! The faces of the democrat party- Frederica, Mad Max, Nancy, and Schmuck spell certain victory for Trump and his supporters.

 But they won't.


Sounds like she’s threatening to kill our POTUS.

Time for the SS to slam her up against the wall handcuff her. She needs to be detained for questioning.
