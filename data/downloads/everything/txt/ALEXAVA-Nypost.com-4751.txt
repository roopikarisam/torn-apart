JACKSON, Miss. — Police in Mississippi’s capital city are charging a 15-year-old boy as an adult, saying he shot a 14-year-old girl in the head.

Jackson Police spokesman Sgt. Roderick Holmes said that police arrested Sheroderick Elmore on aggravated assault charges following a Saturday night shooting in a Jackson neighborhood. The victim is in critical condition at a local hospital.

Holmes says police still don’t know why the boy shot the girl. He says being charged as an adult is appropriate because of the violent crime.

Elmore had not yet been booked into jail Monday evening, and it was unclear when bail would be set or if he had an attorney.
