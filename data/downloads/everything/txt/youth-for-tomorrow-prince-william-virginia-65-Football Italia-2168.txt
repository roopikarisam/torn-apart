	Roma midfielder Radja Nainggolan was greeted by a crowd of Inter fans ahead of his medical tomorrow morning. "I'm happy."


	He drove up to the Hotel Melià, which usually houses new Nerazzurri signings, but went in through a back entrance.


	Nainggolan eventually emerged to greet the supporters and commented to the media: "I'm happy. I hope the fans are happier when I play."


	The deal was struck for €24m cash plus full-back Davide Santon and youth team player Nicolò Zaniolo.


	Santon and Zaniolo will have their medicals at the Villa Stuart clinic in Rome tomorrow morning.


	Nainggolan just turned 30 last month and has been with the Giallorossi since January 2014, arriving at a cost of €18m.


	At San Siro, the Belgium international will be reunited with ex-Roma boss Luciano Spalletti.
