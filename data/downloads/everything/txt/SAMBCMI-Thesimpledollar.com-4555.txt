When it comes to our pets, they’re more than just animals – they are members of our family. As such, many pet owners would do anything to ensure their pets live long, healthy lives. This would include paying thousand annually on everything from routine wellness care to everyday supplies like food. According to Forbes, people who own large dogs spend at least $1,570 a year which, for an average lifespan of 12 years, could come to over $18,000. And that doesn’t include factoring in expensive emergency medical costs.

Those are scary numbers to consider, and it’s easy to see why so many pet owners find themselves in financial predicaments when it comes to caring for their pets. The good news is, there are hundreds of pet financial aid organizations all over the country that can help.

You might not have to surrender your pet to a shelter. Organizations all over the country can help with veterinary care plus the cost of food, supplies, and more.

Choose a state to see which organizations can help you in your area.

Once you’ve found an organization operating in your area, consult our guide on applying for pet financial aid.

There are also plenty of financial aid organizations that aid pet owners across the country. Here are just a few:

There are a couple of things you’ll need to do to determine if you are eligible for pet financial aid. While these requirements can vary by organization, the following are a good place to start.

Before you even decide on which organization to appeal to, take inventory of all of your pet’s needs. Make a list, and include everything from pet food to necessary surgeries (such as spay/neuter). Don’t forget other needs unique to your pet’s condition, like rehabilitative therapy (some organizations feature grants covering such services). Our pet cost calculator can help get you started. Having a better idea of your pet’s individual needs will save you a lot of time and stress when figuring out who to call.

Many of these organizations are geared toward helping pet owners in need. This can mean low-income pet owners and, in some cases, homeless pet owners. You’ll want to have the necessary documentation handy. This can include: proof of Medicaid, proof that your yearly income is below a certain threshold (determined by individual organizations as being “in need” or “low-income”), and any other proof of government assistance.

Generally, applying for pet financial aid should be a last resort. In fact, many of these organizations will explicitly state that they have limited funds and supplies. Some will also recommend a low interest credit card as an option for financing pet care.

If one organization doesn’t reach back out to you, try another in your area. If you are living in a state with limited pet aid organizations, keep your ear to the ground for any smaller scale community efforts. Some state and municipality organizations also offer assistance for low-income pet owners. Consult your local shelter; they’d rather help you find assistance than see you surrender your pet for financial reasons.

There are tons of pet insurance groups that can help cover the cost of emergency treatment and more, but are they really worth it? In a piece written for Forbes Sierra Black covered the question that crosses every pet owner’s mind: Is pet insurance worth the cost?

For Sierra, it wasn’t, but it might not be the same for other pet owners. That’s why it’s important to weigh the financial outcomes of insuring your pet versus not.

As we’ve covered in previous pieces, the cost of pet insurance can range from $60-$70 a month. However, this price varies based on factors like age, breed, and gender. This figure will also most likely lower when you’re talking about a cat versus a dog’s insurance plan. Still, that’s not a high price to pay when you consider that most plans for that price will cover the following:

There are also plans that go for as low as $10 a month and still have enough coverage for those out-of-the-blue emergencies. In an emergency situation, many people would be glad they were insured.

Related:

Cost is usually the biggest caveat. And though pet insurance can offer peace of mind, not all policies are all-inclusive. In fact, services like routine wellness checks usually are not covered, which means you’ll pay those out of pocket. In that sense, it might not seem worth it to pay for insurance to cover the big bad disaster when it might be more a matter of “if” than “when.”

If you’d like to be prepared but aren’t sold on pet insurance, setting up a pet emergency fund is an option worth considering.

Taking care of your pet can be expensive, but it’s not impossible to find the help you need. Use our guide as a starting point and contact your local shelter for more information. Your pets are more than just animals, they are a part of your family — so don’t be afraid to fight for them.
