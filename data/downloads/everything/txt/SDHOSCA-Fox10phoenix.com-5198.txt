ALISO VIEJO (FOX 11 / CNS) - Actor Will Ferrell was riding in an SUV that was involved in a two-vehicle crash on the northbound Santa Ana (5) Freeway in the Aliso Viejo area, it was reported Friday.


The crash occurred about 10:55 p.m. Thursday south of Alicia Parkway, according to the California Highway Patrol.


TMZ reported that Ferrell, 50, was riding in an SUV that "got flipped over'' in the two-vehicle crash, and Ferrell, along with two other people, were taken to a hospital for treatment.


Ferrell was one of three passengers in the chauffeur-driven SUV, which, according to witnesses, was side-swiped by the other vehicle, TMZ reported.


Ferrell, the driver and another man riding in the 2017 Lincoln suffered minor injuries, and a woman riding in the Lincoln suffered "major'' injuries, according to the CHP. 


Ferrell has since been released.


The driver of the other vehicle, a 2007 Toyota, apparently was not hurt. No arrests were reported.


The actor was apparently on his way back from a "Funny or Die'' event outside San Diego in which he appeared as Ron Burgundy.
