How much gold did the two largest mining countries produce in history? 

Since the PBOC began to actively devalue the yuan versus the dollar four weeks ago, the price of COMEX gold has tracked the yuan nearly tick-for tick.

An ancient Babylonian code of law may hold some insight into fixing the rampant greed and corruption that presently exist in our financial industry.

In the latest sign that the FBI is closing in on former Trump personal attorney Michael Cohen, one of the Brooklyn lawyer's business partners has reportedly agreed to cooperate with the Federal government to avoid jail time.

Evgeny Freidman, who was disbarred earlier this month, had been Cohen's business partner for years, helping him manage an expansive taxi empire until he was banned by New York City regulators last year after he failed to pay more than $5 million in taxes.

Freidman instead pleaded guilty to one count of tax evasion this week.

Instead, he appeared in court in Albany on Tuesday and pleaded guilty to a single count of evading only $50,000 worth of taxes; he faces five years of probation if he fulfills the terms of his agreement, the judge, Patrick Lynch of Albany County court, said during the roughly 20-minute proceeding.

“Do you understand the nature of the benefit your attorneys have accomplished on your behalf?” the judge asked Mr. Freidman during the proceeding on Tuesday.

"I greatly understand that and appreciate it," Mr. Freidman replied.

After Mr. Freidman’s guilty plea, his lawyer, Patrick J. Egan of Fox Rothschild, declined to comment. But earlier this year, he said his client "considers Michael a very good friend and a great client."

Freidman had been facing four counts of criminal tax fraud and one of grand larceny - all class B felonies that carried maximum prison sentences of up to 25 years in prison.

Freidman will avoid jail time if he cooperates with state and federal prosecutors in their investigation of Cohen.

Thanks to Freidman's cooperation, President Trump's lawyers are growing increasingly worried that Cohen might also take a deal to cooperate with prosecutors against the president as he faces a potentially lengthy prison term. To be sure, Cohen has repeatedly denied speculation that he too might turn on the president, repeatedly saying in the press that he would do anything to protect Trump.  

While it's unclear what, exactly, Freidman might be able to tell the Feds about his partner's purportedly criminal activities, revelations earlier this month about Cohen's shady consulting agreements with major US companies seeking to curry favor with Trump have raised questions about whether he might've used the president's name to cash in on his connections. These revelations were made by Stormy Daniels Lawyer Michael Avenatti, who published details from leaked FinCEN suspicious activity reports.

Rat bastard...

Flip?  Then Cohen flips?  There's nothing to "flip".  MULEr doesn't have a case.  Trump didn't "collude", the deep state attempted a coup.

It's obvious, the Russian's took a cab somewhere. In our present "Show me the man, I'll show you the crime." DOJ, FBI, CIA, this is good enough for a FISA warrant.

Comey's made so many contradictory statements it'd be hard to take anything he said at face value, let alone use it in a court setting. Well, unless you were Obama's justice department.

Mueller does not have a case. You are correct. He is outside of constitutional boundaries. This is the biggest nothing burger waste of time in the history of the US. And Mueller has figured that out in the last week or so. Stupid as shit is an understatement. If an Obama judge takes and prosecutes it, it will be a bigger laughing stock for decades to come. Non of these prosecutions have anything to do with Russian collision. That is the allowed scope of the investigation. They convictions will be overturned in a NY minute on appeal. If the Supreme Court gets any of this crap, it will be lights out, even with a tilted judiciary.

Good bye Mueller, we hardly new you. You apparently have been involved in some deep state cover ups and crimes as well. What if the prosecutor get prosecuted...

Dude, put on a dress and some lipstick, hire Gloria Allred and hit a few talk shows.  Screech about "Transphobia" a lot.

It may not save you from Pound You in the Ass Prison, but it will be highly entertaining for us.

ROTFLMAO     50,000 on 5,000,000..    pretty strong case 1%..      Wonder who taxes were for?     This is great... wonder if city or state if this has to be Schneiderman and Bharara.  The court system tax system is worse than the mob, corrupt as hell.   Like to see that guy's medallion bills. Last time I heard over a million a pop.  Wow Mueller and HRC are desperate.  This stuff is funny as all get up.   Think NY tax rate is 8.8%.    7.8%  saved 390,000 bucks. Explain this again to me?

Fox Rothschild?  More rabbit boiling to come...

Salt of the earth ratfink motherfucker.

I'm sure the jury will believe this slimeball's testimony.

I read elsewhere that he has to pay $5 million in restitution as well

Lawyers and politicians going to jail is a good thing.

Mueller should use a bunch of shady snitches as his foundation for a case...like he did with the Hells Angels case.

 

Wait...that didn't work out so well after all. 

What exactly has Cohen himself been charged with? 

Oh my God.  This is terrible.  How dare they investigate a scumbag lawyer for doing illegal things.  Don't they know this is America!  It's in the Constitution, Article 39, Section 4: "Any orange headed asshole who gets elected and has a stupid last name and numerous prostitutes as wives shall be immune from truth, justice and the American way...including any scumbag lawyer who works for him."

You could look that up...if you could read, but you probably all got a degree from Trump University, so....

lawyers are all scumbags by definition.

Apparently, there is no honor among Jews.

A guess would be they use him to get Cohen to tell a tale against Trump. Doubtful it will work. I'm thinking Cohen has to be one of the best fixers in DC. Trump only hires the best. At some point one of Cohen's other clients will put a stop to this if that is true.

Cohen who?  Seriously, have no idea, I can't keep up with the target practice du jour

"I will hire only the best people"....

what a fucking clown

Across the country, the Trump Organization is suing local governments, claiming it owes much less in property taxes than government assessors say because its properties are worth much less than they’ve been valued at. The Trump Organization says the president’s property holdings are worth far less than he has proclaimed.

Since becoming president, Trump’s companies have filed at least nine new lawsuits against municipalities arguing for lower tax bills.
At stake is millions of dollars that communities use to fund roads, schools and police departments. 

And yet the mindless masses continue to praise the "Myth of the Good King".

Remember when Trump declared that his not paying taxes made him "smart" during his debate with Clinton 2.0?

"When The New York Times showed that Donald Trump may have used a legal
loophole to avoid paying federal income taxes for years, many people expected the
self-described billionaire to be embarrassed. Instead, in a debate with Hillary
Clinton, Donald Trump said...

DONALD TRUMP: That makes me smart."
