A coroner says a 6-year-old Kentucky boy died of an accidental, self-inflicted gunshot wound

ELIZABETHTOWN, Ky. (AP) — A coroner says a 6-year-old Kentucky boy died of an accidental, self-inflicted gunshot wound.

Hardin County Coroner William Lee told The News-Enterprise said Malachi Fryer was hit with a single shot to the head inside his home Tuesday. An autopsy was performed Wednesday in Louisville.

Hardin County Sheriff John Ward said the child and his mother were at home when 30-year-old Jacory Williams of Radcliff arrived around 4 a.m. with a bag containing a video game system and a handgun. Ward said the child woke, grabbed the handgun, went into his bedroom and pulled the trigger.

Williams was arrested Tuesday and charged with possession of a handgun by a convicted felon. He was in jail Wednesday, and online records didn’t list an attorney who could speak on his behalf.
