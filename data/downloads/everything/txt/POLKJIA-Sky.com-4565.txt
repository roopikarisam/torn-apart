A woman was pulled over by police in the Tampa Bay Area of Florida after riding her horse down a main road while drunk.

Donna Byrne, 53, was arrested and charged after a member of the public called the police to report a woman on horseback who appeared confused and possibly in danger.


When deputies from Polk County Sheriff's Office arrived they found her riding her horse in the busy road.


Officers carried out a breath-test, which showed her to be more than twice the legal limit.


The horse - named Bo Duke after a character on popular US TV series The Dukes Of Hazzard - was tied to a deputy's patrol car and ate grass as Byrne was assisted by police.


When Byrne was taken to Polk County Jail, Bo Duke was taken to the Polk County Sheriff's Animal Control livestock facility.


Byrne has been charged with DUI and animal neglect for endangering and failing to provide proper protection for her horse.


Sheriff Grady Judd said: "Ms Byrne was obviously not in any condition to be on the road. She not only put herself and the horse in danger, but also anyone who was driving on the road, which is typically very busy."


The Polk County Sheriff's Office has said it is taking the situation seriously, but it is most likely Bo Duke will be returned to his owner in due course.
