The Los Angeles Police Department says one of its officers has been arrested on suspicion of workers’ compensation fraud.

Officials say Officer John Bailey was taken into custody this week after a felony warrant was issued for his arrest.


City News Service reports the investigation stems from a medical claim filed by Bailey earlier this year. The 43-year-old is accused of knowingly committing workers’ compensation fraud and receiving benefits under false pretenses.



Bailey, who lives in San Bernardino County, was jailed in lieu of $60,000 bail.
