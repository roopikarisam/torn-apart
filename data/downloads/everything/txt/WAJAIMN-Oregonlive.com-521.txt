A 38-year-old man was arrested Thursday and accused of killing a Forest Grove woman found dead in her apartment last month.

Kamen R. Baer was booked into the Washington County Jail on suspicion of murder for the death of 54-year-old Cynthia Belton. She was discovered dead in her apartment on March 19 after police responded to the unit for a welfare check.

Baer was arrested at a home in the 100 block of Southeast 26th Avenue in Hillsboro, according to Forest Grove police Capt. Michael Hall. He declined to comment further on the case, citing an ongoing investigation.

Baer is described by police as a transient. He was sentenced to a year and a half in prison in February 2014 after being sentenced in Washington County for attempted first-degree sexual abuse and third-degree sexual abuse involving another woman, according to Oregon court records. A judge ordered Baer to register as a sex offender.
