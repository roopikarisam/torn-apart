The twisted ex-nurse, who had a sick fetish for human flesh, fled to the US in 2014 to stay with friends, but they kicked him out after learning of his crimes


Canterbury Cannibal Dale Bolinger has been moved to a US psychiatric hospital for high-risk sex offenders.

The twisted ex-nurse, who fantasised about beheading and eating a 14-year-old girl, fled to the US after being freed early from prison.

He was jailed for nine years by Canterbury crown court in 2014.

The sick fetishist, 62, stayed with friends in Nebraska until they realised the enormity of his crimes. His hosts feared they would be attacked by vigilantes so kicked him out.

Ten days after arriving in the US in January, police moved him to Washington County Jail despite him not committing any crimes.

On Thursday he was moved to the Norfolk Regional Center, a hospital housing some of Nebraska’s most serious sex offenders. 

County Attorney Scott Vander Schaaf said: “Mr Bolinger is not currently a danger to the community and his present location is known.”

Bolinger bought an axe before he was due to meet a girl at Ashford rail station in Kent but she did not show up, his trial heard.

On the Dark Fetish Network he listed his main fetish as “cannibalism, mainly the hunting and preparation of young (and sometimes not so young) women”.

He was convicted of trying to groom a child under 16 for sex.
