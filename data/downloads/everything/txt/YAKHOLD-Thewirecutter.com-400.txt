					$170 $119 from eBay				

30% off


Via today’s one day promotion, we were able to find the CR4BT speakers even cheaper at $119 with code PRIMOSALE. The Mackie CR4BT are the runner-up pick in our guide to the best computer speakers. Slightly larger than our top pick, the Mackie CR3, these speakers provide better bass performance due to the larger 4″ woofers they offer. Grab these today if interested as this price won’t be around long.


					$650 $585 from Amazon				

10% off


Down to $585, this discount matches the price of recent promotions we’ve seen for this TV. The TCL 55R617 is the 55-inch version of our top pick in our guide to the best LCD/LED TV. While this isn’t the best price we’ve seen on this television, it’s within $30 of the low we’ve noted. As it usually goes for $650, this is a price worth noting.


					$265 $180 from Best Buy				

32% off


If you have wood floors or tile, the Shark IonFlex DuoClean Cordless Ultra-Light is a strong contender and our runner-up pick in our guide to the best cordless stick vacuum. Its swappable battery also could mean this vacuum’s life could potentially be extended with the purchase of a 2nd. It’s down to $180 from a street price of around $265, matching the low we’ve seen for it. Also available for $180 via Amazon.


					$45 $33 from Amazon				

27% off


Down to $33 for Prime members, this is the best price we’ve seen this year on this already affordable coffee maker. The Hamilton Beach 12-Cup is the top pick in our guide to the best cheap coffee maker. While we saw a sub $30 price for it around Halloween of last year and again during Black Friday, it’s consistently been above $45 and often as much as $55 since. If you’re trying to get a decent cup of coffee on a budget, it’s a nice option.


					$100 $70 from Amazon				

30% off


Down to $70 from a typical price of $100 for Prime members, this is the best price we’ve seen on this recommended USB microphone. The Shure MV5 is the runner-up pick in our guide to the best USB microphone. We saw this mic at $80 throughout the holidays of last year, but it has since bounced back up to the usual street price, so this is an excellent opportunity to save.


					$4 $3 from Amazon				

25% off


As an add-on item for Amazon Prime members, our portable pencil sharpener is down to a new low of $3. This is typically priced at $4 so it isn’t a huge dollar discount but definitely nice in terms of percentage off. The Prismacolor Premier Pencil Sharpener is our pencil sharpener pick in our guide to the best colored pencils. If you use colored or graphite pencils often this is the best price we’ve seen.


					$25 $17 from Amazon				

32% off


Down to $17 from typical pricing of around $25, this is a nice drop and one of the better prices we’ve seen on this 36-pack of assorted color dry-erase markers. Expo Low-Odor are the dry-erase marker pick in our guide to the best home-office furniture and supplies. While we briefly saw this pack lower around the holidays of last year, they haven’t seen a better price since.


					$75 $55 from Amazon				

27% off


We rarely see sales that include all sizes of this particular shoe in any color, so this is a solid opportunity if you like the turquoise color of the runner-up pick in our guide to the best running shoes for women. Featuring a softer, more cushioned feel in a running shoe, at $55 this is the lowest price we’ve seen for it, granted in the lone color discounted at this time.


					$300 $239 from Amazon				

20% off


Update 4: This humidifier continues to drop, now down to $239 from the original deal price of $256. Down to $256 in the black color, this is a good price on the Venta LW25 Airwasher relative to recent pricing of around $300. This humidifier/purifier is our less maintenance upgrade pick in our guide to the best humidifier. While this model has dipped into the low $200s on very rare occasions, it’s more often much higher.


					$30 $21 from Amazon				

30% off


Update: As the temperature continues to climb, this heater will slowly drop, down an extra few bucks to $21 in black, and $23 in white.. While you certainly don’t need it now, this is a solid chance to save on this popular space heater before temperatures drop again and the price jumps accordingly. The Honeywell UberHeat HCE200W is our runner-up pick in our guide in our guide to the best space heater. Usually around $30, the white model is down to $25.


					$60 $48 from Amazon				

20% off


Available for $48 in all sizes of the Jade/Petrol colorway and the x-small, medium, and large sizes of the Oasis/Icemint colorway, this is a nice deal on this recommended women’s climbing harness. The Edelrid Jayne II is our top pick for women in our guide to the best entry-level climbing harnesses. Usually $60, this is a nice drop for it, but we’re seeing low stock in some sizes, so grab one while it lasts.


					$30 $21 from Amazon				

30% off


At $21, this is a solid deal on all available colors of a travel neck pillow we like, the Trtl Pillow. Our pick for one sided sleepers in our guide to the best travel pillow, we also praise it for its portability. Usually $30, we’ve seen it as low as $20 on occasion but this is a good discount if you’re in the market for a travel pillow and don’t tend to shift positions when sleeping.


					$900 $800 from Amazon				

11% off


Although we’ve posted multiple sub $800 deals on the DJI Mavic Pro (plus remote), this is the lowest price we’ve seen new within the last four months. We see this drone for as much as $1000 but we estimate the street price to be about $900. The DJI Mavic Pro is the top pick in our guide to the best drone. Amazon prices for this drone tend to fluctuate quite a bit, this deal probably won’t last long.


					$23 $20 from Amazon				

13% off


If you’re an avid runner or even just someone that likes to stay active outside, this is the lowest price we’ve seen for the waist-mounted water bottle we recommend. The fuchsia and purple color is down to $20 from $23. This color is typically priced lower than the others and we’ve never seen it for less. The Nathan Peak Waist Pack is the waistbelt water bottle pick in our guide to the best running gear.


					$350 $300 from eBay				

14% off


Use code PRIMOSALE to drop the price of this refurbished cordless stick vacuum (in yellow) from $350 to $300. It’s a nice savings as the V8 Absolute still goes for between $425 and $475 new. The Dyson V8 Absolute is the upgrade pick in our guide to the best cordless stick vacuum. This is one in a series of code discounts available for this model over the past few months, but it’s rare to ever see it lower.


					$16 $11 from Amazon				

31% off


If you’re shopping for hex wrenches this matches the lowest price we’ve seen on the set we recommend for most people. At $11, this is a nice discount from it’s street price of $16. The TEKTON 25282 26-piece Long Arm Ball Hex Key Wrench Set is the top pick in our guide to the best hex wrenches.

					$170 $140 from Amazon				

18% off


If you’re looking for computer speakers that function well wired but also have Bluetooth connectivity, the Mackie CR4BT are nicely discounted right now. Usually $170, they’re down to $140. The Mackie CR4BT are the runner-up pick in our guide to the best computer speakers. Slightly larger than our top pick, the Mackie CR3, these speakers provide better bass performance due to the larger 4″ woofers they offer.


					$100 $86 from Amazon				

14% off


Update 2: Although we saw it drop down to $81 for a few days, it’s now up an extra $5 to $86. Down to $90 from a historical street price of around $100, while this isn’t a huge discount, it’s notable in that it’s the lowest price we’ve seen for the WD My Book external hard drive in the 4TB size. That’s more than enough storage for most, so grab our top pick in our guide to the best external desktop hard drive while this price lasts.


					$290 $238 from Amazon				

18% off


Update 2: Down $32 from the original deal price of $270 to $238, a new low price. The Samsung 860 EVO is the runner-up in our guide to the best SSDs that’s a little better than our top pick but also more expensive. The 1TB version of this SSD is down to a new low price of $270 from a street price of $290 and is more storage for your money than any deal we’ve seen for the 500GB version. Although this isn’t a significant discount we’ve never seen the 1TB fall lower than $280.

27% off

Down to $70 in the purple color, this matches the lowest price we’ve seen for these kids headphones. The black and white colors, while not as heavily discounted, are down to $80, so this is an good opportunity to pick up the Puro BT2200 at a discount.  They’re our top pick in our guide to the best kids headphones, and while we’ve seen them multiple times at $80, $70 is rare and even $80 is still a good price.


					$130 $110 from Amazon				

15% off


If you’re seeking some large checked luggage but don’t want to overspend, the Delsey Helium Aero 29-Inch is a nice polycarbonate hard shell option. Usually $130, the blue color is down to $110, a solid drop if you want the maximum packing room allowed. The silver color is also down to $115 which is a good price for that color as it’s street price is a little higher at $140.

					$260 $194 from Amazon				

25% off


Update 4: After a week long dip down to $184, the price is now starting to go back up. At $206, this is a nice drop on the HP OfficeJet Pro 8730, nearly matching the $200 low we saw in early May. The HP OfficeJet Pro 8730 is our runner-up pick in our guide to the best all-in-one printer, offering more memory, single-pass duplex scanning, and PDF and Word file printing from a USB stick versus our top pick.

Headspace is the top pick in our guide to the best meditation apps. Usually $96 for a yearly subscription, this promotion knocks the cost down to $58.  As Headspace can cost as much as $13 a month if purchased on a month to month basis, this discounted annual membership is a nice way to save.


					$13 $9 from Amazon				

31% off


Update: Now down to $9, but only as an add-on item. The black color of our favorite tweezers is back down to $10 from a street price around $13. We’ve posted a previous deal at an all time low of $7 as an add0on item before but we aren’t sure when we’ll see a discount like that again. The Tweezerman Slant Tip is the top pick in our guide to the best tweezers. This product is prone to a lot of price fluctuations so this deal isn’t likely to last long.


					$120 $94 from Amazon				

22% off


Update: Down to $94, this is a new low on this runner-up gaming keyboard. Usually $120, the Cooler Master Masterkeys Pro S RGB with MX Brown switches is down to $110.

The Fletchers’ Mill Muddler, 11-Inch is the muddler pick from our guide to the best barware for making cocktails at home. Previous deals haven’t lasted long and we have no reason to believe this one will either.


					$45 $36 from Amazon				

20% off


Typically priced between $40 and $50, the drop to $36 is a new low price. However, we’ve seen the price dropping within the past month, that might indicate some even lower prices in the future. The 35-mile-range Antennas Direct ClearStream Eclipse is the top pick in our guide to the best HDTV antenna. This is the first deal we’ve posted on this product so we aren’t sure how long it will last.

47% off


At $50 from a typical price around $95, this is a nice drop on the coral color of the Google Daydream View VR Headset (2017), matching the low we’ve seen.

					$45 $35 from Amazon				

22% off


If you’re interested in the Echo Dot and have passed to this point, this is a solid deal on the diminutive smart speaker in black or white at $35. Prime Day is looming and there will no doubt be Alexa-exclusive deals, and while we don’t consider that a reason to buy this speaker, it’s a bonus if you want one anyway (though we think we’ll see this speaker at least $5 cheaper then). The Dot is our affordable Echo pick in our guide to Amazon’s Alexa smart speaker line.



					$35 $25 from Target				

29% off


Down to $25 from a normal price of $35 if you opt for store pickup or are a REDcard holder (you’ll save an additional 5% with REDCard), this is a solid price and as low as we typically see the Chromecast Audio.

					$200 $110 from Amazon				

45% off

					$450 $380 from B&amp;H				

16% off


Update 2: Although it’s not currently in stock, it’s now down an extra $20 to $380, and is expected to ship in a week. Available in the Very Silver finish only, this is an interesting deal on the Google Pixel 1st Gen with 128GB of storage. It’s hard to find in new condition at this point, but those that carry it are selling it for substantially more and used models aren’t selling for much less. This phone is mentioned positively in our upcoming piece on the best smartphone cameras. Per Ryan Whitwam, “A first-gen Pixel will take better photos than a new phone that costs $300-ish.”


					$50 $36 from Walmart				

28% off

The PetSafe PetSafe Healthy Pet Simply Feed Automatic Feeder is the huge capacity while sacrificing accuracy pick in our guide to the best automatic feeder for cats and small dogs. While it may not be good for pets on a diet as it didn’t consistently dispense accurate amounts with kibble larger than 1/2 inch, we liked it for its 24-cup capacity.


					$850 $800 from Amazon				

6% off


While camera price drops tend to be pretty universal across retailers, this is still a decent $50 discount on this recommended camera. The Sony RX100 Mark IV is our better image quality in good lighting pick in our guide to the best vlogging cameras and gear.

Down to $22 from $27 we’ve posted a similar deal on this charging stand before. We expect this deal will last a couple weeks but we might see a better deal in the future.

At $1450, while we’d love to see the price fall a bit more, this recommended gaming laptop is back to the deal price of a few days ago.

17% off


Update 2: Back up to the original deal price after a few days down to $900. Back down to $1000, this is a solid price on the Paradigm Soundscape Soundbar. This luxury soundbar, our upgrade pick, still typically goes for around $1200 at many retailers, so this drop offers serious savings. It lacks HDMI, but we think the optical inputs and other wireless options (Bluetooth, wireless sub adapter) and great sound make this a very compelling option.

Down to $230 in a few colors, this is a solid deal on our top pick in our guide to the best convertible car seat. Usually around $270, it’s seen periodic drops to $240 on sale, but this drop taking it $10 lower is more uncommon.

There are a multitude of 4th of July appliance sales out there, and most result in price matching across retailers, but a few aren’t universally matched. This drop to $1530 for the Whirlpool WRF535SMHZ, a pick in our guide to the best refrigerator, is a good example. While we’re seeing the same price at Best Buy, other major retailers aren’t matching. It’s usually $1700, so while this isn’t a huge discount, it’s a solid one. This fridge performed as well as our top pick but lacks in-door ice or water.

It’s very similar to our top pick and you might consider picking it up instead if you’re shopping for monitors as our top pick is currently unavailable from most retailers.


					$80 $63 from Amazon				

21% off


Down to $63 from $80 for the black color, this is the lowest price we’ve seen since November. During Black Friday we saw this stroller drop to an all time low of $43; $63 is the only significant drop we’ve seen since then.
