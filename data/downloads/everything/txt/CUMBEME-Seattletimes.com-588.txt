PORTLAND, Maine (AP) — Attorney General Janet Mills says she’s filed a civil rights complaint against a man who made derogatory sexual comments to female workers a Portland, Maine, restaurant.

Mills said Thursday she’s requesting an order barring 37-year-old Jesse James Taylor, of Portland, from coming into Sisters Gourmet Deli or having contact with employees.

Mills said Taylor entered the restaurant July 29 and yelled anti-gay epithets at the women. She said Taylor threatened the women with violence based on bias against their gender and sexual orientation.

Police said Taylor pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct and was sentenced to five days in Cumberland County Jail. Portland police say they believe mental illness played a role in the incident.

Efforts to reach Taylor were unsuccessful Thursday.
