An inmate who escaped from a West Virginia jail was captured Sunday while trying to make it to Mexico.

Todd Wayne Boyes, 44, was stopped at 4 a.m. as he attempted to cross the Rio Grande from Laredo, Tex., West Virginia Department of Military Affairs &amp; Public Safety reported.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection caught Boyes about 1,500 miles from Charleston's South Central Regional Jail, where he escaped.

It's unclear how Boyes made it all the way to Texas.

Boyes walked out of the jail Wednesday wearing khaki pants, white sneakers and a dark-colored pullover â€” but he wasn't reported missing for two days.

The Ohio native was scheduled to be sentenced Friday for a carjacking and car chase in which a cop was injured.

Four officers were suspended following his escape, WSAZ-TV reports.
