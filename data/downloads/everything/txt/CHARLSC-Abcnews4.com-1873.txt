Parkers Ferry Road Burned Body and Murder Suspects (Charleston County Detention Center)

A sixth person has been charged in connection to an alleged murder, after which  Charleston County Sheriff's Office investigators say a group of people helped burn the victim's body in hopes it would never be found. 


Breann Wells, 23, of North Charleston was arrested Friday and charged with accessory after the fact to murder and desecration of human remains.


Wells marks the sixth person arrested in connection to the death Louis Richie Cadden, whose charred remains were found behind a home on Parkers Ferry Road in the Adams Run community on March 15.


Sheriff's office investigators believe Wells helped dispose of Cadden's remains by burning them over several days, after a man named Patrick Lee Gregory reportedly shot and killed Cadden.


Gregory is charged with Cadden's murder. According to the sheriff's office, Gregory told witnesses he'd killed Cadden, and that the body would never be found.


Wells' arrest comes after those of  Ralph McClenney, Brian Edwards and Sarah Giggleman, all of whom are charged with accessory after the fact to murder and desecration of human remains.


Sarah Kelley, Gregory's alleged girlfriend, is also charged with accessory after the fact to murder.


All six remain in jail at the Sheriff Al Cannon Detention Center.
