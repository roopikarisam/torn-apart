LOS ANGELES  â€” A decade before his ex-girlfriend was killed in what investigators say was a targeted explosion, Stephen Beal's wife died in what a coroner deemed a "mysterious case."


Christine Beal's death in 2008 came a few weeks after she fell down a flight of stairs in their Long Beach home while carrying a heavy piece of furniture with her husband. The bureau landed on her pelvic and hip area.
