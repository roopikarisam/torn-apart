LEXINGTON, N.C. (AP) â€” Sheriff's deputies in North Carolina have accused a woman of biting her boyfriend after he changed the channel on a television she was watching.

The Winston-Salem Journal reports the Davidson County Sheriff's Office said the man told investigators 21-year-old Abby Nicole Saunders attacked him Saturday when he went into a bedroom to change the channel on the television.


Deputies say the man sustained bite marks on his neck, right forearm and the inside of his left arm. He also had a red mark on his chest where investigators said Saunders hit him.

Online records show Saunders is in the Davidson County jail, but it's not known if she has an attorney.
