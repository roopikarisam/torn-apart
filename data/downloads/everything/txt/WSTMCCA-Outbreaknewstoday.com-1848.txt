The Illinois Department of Public Health (IDPH) is reporting four laboratory-confirmed cases of the mumps among students at Western Illinois University’s Macomb campus. The IDPH is working with WIU’s Beu Health Center and the McDonough County Health Department to investigate and contain the cases.

“Western Illinois University, in partnership with the McDonough County Health Department, has done an excellent job of informing students on how to avoid contracting mumps and what they should do if they begin to have symptoms,” said IDPH Director Dr. Nirav Shah.

The Spring 2018 semester concludes Friday, May 11.

To date, all cases have been among students. Student who have appeared, or are appearing, symptomatic have been/will be isolated for the required five-day isolation period following the onset of symptoms.

Beu Health Center healthcare officials urge individuals who experience symptoms to seek medical treatment immediately. Beu Health Center will be open from 10 a.m.-3 p.m. Saturday-Sunday, May 5-6.

An infected person can spread the virus by coughing, sneezing, kissing or talking; sharing items, such as cups or eating utensils; and touching objects or surfaces with unwashed hands. Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle ache and swelling of the glands close to the jaw.
