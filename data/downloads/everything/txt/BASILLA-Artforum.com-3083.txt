Dave McNary of the Chicago Tribune reports that the Walt Disney Company has lifted its ban against the Los Angeles Times. The corporation originally told the paper that it would not allow its film critics to attend advance screenings of Disney produced and distributed movies over an  article it had published investigating Disney’s troublesome financial relationship to the city of Anaheim, California, where much of the company’s business is centered.


But Disney seems to have changed its tune after representatives from the Los Angeles Film Critics Association, the New York Film Critics Circle, the Boston Society of Film Critics, and the National Society of Film issued a statement condemning Disney’s actions. In the letter the organizations said that they “have voted to disqualify Disney’s films from year-end awards consideration until said blackout is publicly rescinded.” A continued boycott of this sort would've likely had devastating ramifications for the company during awards season. 


A spokesperson from the Disney went on to say the following: “We've had productive discussions with the newly installed leadership at the Los Angeles Times regarding our specific concerns, and as a result, we’ve agreed to restore access to advance screenings for their film critics.”
