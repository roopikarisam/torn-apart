Authorities in Butler County said Wednesday they are looking for a man who so badly burned a cat it had to be shot by police to put it out of its misery.


The Butler County Sheriff's Office alleges Kevin L. Sullivan, 32, set a cat on fire using lighter fluid Sept. 19 on Howard Street in Middletown.


In a news release, sheriff's office spokeswoman Sgt. Melissa Gerhardt said Sullivan initially lied to law enforcement, but the investigation of the incident led police back to Sullivan. 


Middletown police who arrived at Howard Street shot the suffering feline, killing it, authorities said.


Sullivan is wanted on the fifth-degree felony of cruelty to animals.


“This is absolutely disturbing, and this guy definitely needs to be off the streets. I have a room for him here in my jail, where he needs to be," Bulter County Sheriff Richard K. Jones said in the news release. "I don’t understand people who harm or torture a defenseless animal, it is a very cowardly thing to do."


The sheriff's office asks anyone with information on the location of Sullivan to call 513-785-1300 or text "Cops" to 274637 to remain anonymous.
