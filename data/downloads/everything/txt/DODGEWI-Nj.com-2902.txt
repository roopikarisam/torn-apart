A 24-year-old man driving with a suspended license struck and killed a pedestrian in Lakewood on Thursday night, authorities said. 

Township resident Lucas Rodriguez De La Rosa, 53, was hit near the intersection of Ocean Avenue and Pearl Street around 9:50 p.m., Lakewood police said Friday.

De La Rosa was brought to Monmouth Medical Center's Southern Campus in Lakewood, where he was pronounced dead.

The driver, Juan Soriano Ramirez, of Lakewood, stayed at the scene after striking De La Rosa, according to police. He told investigators he didn't see the pedestrian after turning back onto the road from a local business.

The car, a 2002 Dodge Stratus, had damage to the windshield and front bumper, police said. 

Ramirez was charged with causing a death while operating a motor vehicle with a suspended driver's license. He was brought to the Ocean County jail. 

De La Rosa is the second pedestrian killed in Lakewood this week. A 29-year-old man was struck and killed by a car as he tried to cross Route 70 in Lakewood Sunday night.
