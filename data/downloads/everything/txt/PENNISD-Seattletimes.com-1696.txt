RAPID CITY, S.D. (AP) — A Rapid City woman accused of having sexual contact with an inmate while employed at the Pennington County Jail has been given a suspended one-year jail sentence after pleading guilty to a lesser offense.

Thirty-eighty-year-old Kimberly Johnson was accused of having a romantic relationship with a 39-year-old male inmate last September, while working as a staff assistant in the jail’s medical department. She was fired after the alleged incident.

 The Rapid City Journal reports Johnson on Monday pleaded guilty to delivering prohibited items to an inmate. Her lawyer says letters she sent to an inmate under a pseudonym constituted contraband.
