CALDWELL - An ex-deputy in southwestern Idaho authorities say took part in a plan to have inmates attack another inmate has filed notice that he intends to bring a lawsuit contending wrongful termination.


The Idaho Press-Tribune reports that 46-year-old Corey Weathermon of Nampa filed the paperwork earlier this month against Canyon County and the sheriff's office.

Former Canyon County jail deputies Kade McConnell and Weathermon were fired in October and arrested January.


The 26-year-old McConnell is charged with felony solicitation to commit aggravated battery, and 46-year-old Weathermon is charged with felony aiding and abetting the solicitation.


A judge earlier this month ruled there's enough evidence to send to district court the case against the two former deputies. They are currently out on bond, and are scheduled to appear in Third District Court for arraignment on May 4.


Weathermon contends county officials mishandled the investigation against him.
