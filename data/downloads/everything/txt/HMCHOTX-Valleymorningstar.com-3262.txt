HARLINGEN — Palms Behavioral Health, the 94-bed psychiatric hospital that opened a little over a year ago, was awarded $100,000 yesterday for its success in meeting job-creation goals.

The $13 million hospital came to Harlingen to operate in a deeply under-served medical area for patients with psychiatric and behavioral issues.

“In the first year, they created 150 positions, and 52 of those positions meet all the requirements for the job-creation grant,” said Kayla Thomas, commercial recruitment and marketing manager for the Harlingen Economic Development Corp.

“Actually, 75 percent of those 52 jobs meet the highest level for reimbursement.”

The highest level, in this case, are wages in excess of $12 per hour.

Thomas told the HEDC board yesterday the hospital qualified for a total jobs grant reimbursement of $122,500, but because the deal caps a payout at $100,000, $22,500 would carry over to help meet Palms’ grant for the succeeding fiscal year.

Job creation grants are common tools used by local economic development officials to reward companies that decide to locate in their communities by doling out money for each new job created. Depending on the job, these can win a company reimbursement from say $1,000 per job to up to $10,000.

The HEDC last year budgeted nearly a million dollars to a half-dozen companies in anticipation they would meet the job creation goals to which they agreed.

But the success of Palms Behavioral Health hasn’t been shared by other major employers in the city which have deals for job-creation grants with HEDC.

Qualfon, the call center, back office and business outsourcing firm, was allocated $250,000 in the HEDC’s 2016-17 budget but received nothing in fiscal year 2016-17 because it missed hiring goals.

Qualfon’s original incentive package was a total of $700,000 for creation of up to 1,300 jobs over five years. The HEDC has zeroed out funding for job creation for Qualfon for 2017-18.

United Launch Alliance, the space company, failed to meet its job numbers after laying off 43 employees this summer to reduce staffing to about 75.

ULA was supposed to receive $350,000 for job creation in FY 16-17, but was awarded just $150,000.

Other companies, like Fox Valley Molding and Texas State Rentals, each earned about half of the total budgeted to them for job creation, $21,083 and $17,500, respectively.

The medical community in Harlingen has become a major economic engine for the city and the region’s economy. To emphasize that, Palms Behavioral Health is expected to continue its growth pattern when it comes to job creation.

“They will ultimately have about 225 employees — they’re up to 150 or so employees right now, which is right in line with what they were planning on doing in the first year,” Raudel Garza, the HEDC’s manager and chief executive officer, said after the meeting.

“Most of those jobs are very good, high-paying jobs, so with anything that’s health-related or medical-related, we welcome those types of companies because they have a very positive impact on the economy,” he said.

“The more people are making, the more they’re spending,” he added. “And we’re seeing that come to fruition with our sales tax numbers, also.”

State sales tax allocations released yesterday showed Harlingen continuing its very strong showing, up 8.33 percent this August over the past one, and up 5.09 percent for the year.
