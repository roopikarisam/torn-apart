Conservative principles at work.

We go to work in the mo'nin/Just a-dawn of day/Just at the settin' of the sun/That's when da work is done/ Ooh, I'm down on old Parchman Farm


—Bukka White, 1940.


The South has not been alone in finding creative new ways to monetize the incarcerated, but it does have a very long history, fabled in song and story, but mostly in song, of doing that very thing. Of course, we have a new class of inmate these days—the undocumented immigrant, scooped up in raids and held in “detention centers” for as long as it takes the system to process them out of the country. 


According to the Southern Poverty Law Center, in a place called the Stewart Detention Center, a private prison in Lumpkin, Georgia, it has been determined that there’s money to be made while the system works its dark magic of disappearing meat-packers and farm workers.


The full complaint is here. The SPLC has filed similar lawsuits in four other states: California, Washington, Colorado and Texas.


Ah, the company store. Maybe we’ll get some more good songs out of this, and in several languages, too. 


Anyway, what we have here are people who come to America and do miserable jobs for low wages. Then they get rousted, rounded up, and stuck in private facilities where they are forced to do even more miserable jobs for practically no wages. So much winning.


Nobody would deny that the release of the James Comey memos, and the president*’s subsequent nutty over them, are not important news, and we will get to them presently. But, if you want to see how hard it’s going to be to uproot modern conservatism, and the Trumpism that was its inevitable consequence, you have to keep track of things like what’s going on in these detention centers, where basic humanity comes at a price. There will be a terrible reckoning one day, if the people of this country have the guts to face it.
