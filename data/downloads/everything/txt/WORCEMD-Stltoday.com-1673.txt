About a 1,000 protesters gather outside the St. Louis city Justice Center on Monday, Sept. 18, 2017. Protesters raised money to bail people out of jail after police arrested arrested 123 people on Sunday. Protests began on Friday after former police officer Jason Stockley was found not guilty in the 2011 fatal shooting of Anthony Lamar Smith. Photo by David Carson, dcarson@post-dispatch.com

In the past three years, the photo staff at the St. Louis Post-Dispatch has spent a lot of time covering protests. The challenge is not only finding pictures that tell the story of that day’s protest, but also capturing new images that are unique from all the other photos made at previous protests.

The photo was a surprise. It was taken during the fourth night of protests in St. Louis after the not-guilty verdict in the Jason Stockley murder trial. Stockley, a former St. Louis police officer, was accused of murdering Anthony Lamar Smith in 2011. After the verdict was announced, weeks of protests followed. The night before this picture was taken, St. Louis police arrested 123 people, including an undercover police officer, an Air Force officer, numerous journalists, and onlookers. Many of those arrested complained about police misconduct during the arrests. The FBI and federal prosecutors are now investigating allegations of potential civil rights violations by law enforcement officers during the protests. 

On this night about 1,000 people showed up outside the St. Louis City Justice Center jail to call for the release of those who were arrested and to raise money to bail them out. It started out looking like many of the other protests we’ve covered. Some organizers addressed the crowd using a megaphone, the crowd cheered, held signs and chanted.

A unique moment materialized when one of the organizers with a megaphone called on everyone to hold up their cellphone with the flashlight turned on. It was an impressive sight, almost beautiful. I knew that I needed to get a little elevated to show an overall of the scene. The Renaissance Revival Style of City Hall looming in the background really helped make the picture not only visually but added a context for the photo.

The photo ran across the front page of the paper the next day. I liked that the image is so different from the photos from earlier Stockley protests and that it showed people in an unexpectedly beautiful moment.
