Kansas City Chiefs defensive tackle Roy Miller was arrested early Saturday in Florida on a domestic battery charge, according to Duval County jail records.

A copy of the arrest report acquired by the Guardian said officers responded to a call of a domestic battery at 12:15am on Saturday morning.

Miller’s wife of six and a half years, Nicole, told police the couple had spent the night on a date at the Jacksonville Zoo before traveling home in separate Ubers, where an argument over her husband’s whereabouts escalated to a physical confrontation. 

Nicole Miller told police her husband grabbed her by the hair, struck her in the face and tore a braid from the back of her head, adding that he threw her phone in the toilet and physically restrained her from retrieving it. Ultimately, she was able to recover her phone from the toilet and call police.

Roy Miller was jailed shortly before 5am by the Jacksonville sheriff’s office. The incident involved a minor injury, but no other details were available about the alleged battery.

Local news outlets reported that Miller was released on his own recognizance after an initial court appearance Saturday. Another hearing was set for 28 November.

The Chiefs, who are off this week, said in statement to the Associated Press that they were aware of the incident and gathering facts. They declined any further comment.

The 30-year-old Miller, who was drafted out of Texas by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, spent the past four seasons with the Jacksonville Jaguars. Miller signed a $1.4m deal with Kansas City this past offseason but has only appeared in seven games with two tackles.

The AFC West-leading Chiefs (6-3) visit the New York Giants on 18 November.
