It's never too late to learn.

A Florida man apparently needed a little primer on sticking up a financial institution as he told cops that he had to search Google for "how to rob a bank" just before committing the act.

According to a release from the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office, William Joe Johnson entered Achieva Credit Union in Pinellas Park late Thursday morning, suggested he had a gun, and demanded cash from a teller.

Police say after running off with the fruits of his hastily researched labor, the 26-year-old spent the undisclosed sum on utilities, rent and a drug binge.

Some of the top results to appear when you go looking on Google for heist help is Deadspin's "How To Rob A Bank, As Told By An Actual Bank Robber," the IMDB page for the very low-rated 2007 comedy "How to Rob a Bank" and a Time magazine article titled "Thinking About Robbing a Bank? Read This First," the gist of which is that payoffs are surprisingly low — averaging $4,000 — in the unlikely event you're not caught.

However, it seems like Johnson didn't read that last one: Deputies with the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office arrested him at a nearby hotel Monday following an investigation.

Johnson is being held at the Pinellas County Jail without bond due to an outstanding warrant for failing to appear on a prior sexual assault case.

That case is also pending.
