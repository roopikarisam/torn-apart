A 40-year-old man was arrested late Thursday on suspicion of killing a woman and attacking another man in a Tualatin home.

Michael S. Ross is being held in the Washington County Jail Friday on suspicion of murder and attempted murder. 

Officers responded to a reported assault at a home in the 17000 block of Southwest Shawnee Trail a little before 11 p.m. and found the injured 47-year-old man and 73-year-old woman, Tualatin police said. The woman was dead by the time officers arrived and the man had apparent serious injuries.

Ross was also inside the home and was arrested. Police have not yet released the identities of the two other people involved, how they were hurt or what led to the attack.  

The case remains under investigation.
