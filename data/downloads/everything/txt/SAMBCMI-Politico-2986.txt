Good afternoon, and welcome to PI. Tips: tmeyer@politico.com. Twitter: @theodoricmeyer.

WHAT THE NUMBERS MEAN: K Street reported another strong quarter with a tax reform bill on the horizon and the possibility that Congress will do something it hasn’t done in the first nine months of Donald Trump’s presidency: move major legislation. Several top firms saw their revenue climb higher than the second quarter, including Brownstein Hyatt Farber Schreck, BGR Group, Holland &amp; Knight, Cornerstone Government Affairs, Capitol Counsel and Mehlman Castagnetti Rosen &amp; Thomas. Other firms saw their numbers slip slightly from the second quarter but remain far ahead of where they were a year ago, including Akin Gump Strauss Hauer &amp; Feld, which led the pack with revenue of $9.6 million in the third quarter, down from $9.7 million in the second quarter.

— Some lobbyists feared earlier in the year that billings might slow down if Congress couldn’t pass major legislation, but those fears haven’t come to pass. “I think this administration has been so active on the administrative and the regulatory side that we haven’t seen that kind of slowdown,” said Elizabeth Gore, the chairwoman of Brownstein Hyatt’s government relations practice. She said she expects tax reform will drive additional business, as well as plenty of health care, financial services and energy and environmental work. “The pace of activity has increased,” said Darrell Conner, a lobbyist at K&amp;L Gates, the No. 10 firm by revenue. “I expect it’s going to increase further in the fourth quarter.”

— Not all firms are posting record numbers, of course. The Podesta Group, a bipartisan firm that was viewed as close to the Obama administration, saw its revenue decline to $4.8 million from $5.2 million in the second quarter and $6.1 million in the third quarter of 2016. (The firm didn’t provide its numbers to PI, so revenue is estimated based on disclosure filings.) Subject Matter, a well-known Democratic-leaning shop, also saw its revenue slip slightly to $2 million, compared with $2.1 million in the second quarter and $2.4 million in the third quarter of 2016. “As you can see — and not unexpectedly — we’re trailing a little behind where we were this time last year,” Steve Elmendorf, a Subject Matter founder, wrote in an email. But the firm’s creative content, advertising and strategic communications practices “have made up for this modest decline and then some,” Elmendorf added. He expects overall revenue to grow this year.

INSIDE THE FILINGS: The second-largest single contract of the quarter belonged to Nord Stream 2 AG, a subsidiary of the Russian energy giant Gazprom, which paid Roberti Global $650,000 to lobby against a Russia sanctions bill that Trump ended up signing, among other issues. Nord Stream 2 shelled out another $150,000 to Capitol Counsel during the quarter and $80,000 to the Hawksbill Group. Each firm only reported lobbying Congress, though Roberti Global subcontracted with former Rep. John Sweeney (R-N.Y.) of SMW Partners to lobby the White House.

— Oracle, meanwhile, “shelled out a record $3.82 million lobbying government officials during the 2017 third quarter, new disclosures show, but the company cautioned the number inadvertently captured legal work unrelated to its influence efforts,” POLITICO’s Steven Overly reports. “The reported sum represents a 90 percent increase over the $2.01 million Oracle spent in the third quarter of last year and handily beats the previous record of $2.79 million set last quarter. Ken Glueck, Oracle's senior vice president for public affairs, attributed the substantial increase to legal work on government contracts that was mistakenly lumped into the filing. Oracle does not plan to amend the filing, but will not include the legal work spending in future quarters, he said.” Full story.

MUELLER INVESTIGATING PODESTA, NBC NEWS REPORTS: “Tony Podesta and the Podesta Group are now the subjects of a federal investigation being led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller, three sources with knowledge of the matter told NBC News,” NBC News’ Tom Winter and Julia Ainsley report. “The probe of Podesta and his Democratic-leaning lobbying firm grew out of Mueller's inquiry into the finances of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, according to the sources. … Manafort had organized a public relations campaign for a non-profit called the European Centre for a Modern Ukraine. Podesta's company was one of many firms that worked on the campaign, which promoted Ukraine's image in the West.” Full story.

EQUIFAX HIRES DLA PIPER: Equifax hired DLA Piper on Sept. 20 to help the company respond to congressional inquiries into its massive data breach and botched response, according to new disclosure filings. DLA Piper billed Equifax $20,000 for its work in the quarter — which sounds like a modest fee until you recall that the company hired DLA Piper with only 10 days left in the quarter.

— The filings identify two DLA Piper lobbyists who worked for Equifax: Ignacio Sanchez and Steven Phillips. Missing from either filing is the name of former Sen. Saxby Chambliss (R-Ga.), a DLA Piper partner who could be clearly seen advising Richard Smith, the former Equifax chief executive who was ousted days after the company hired DLA Piper, during congressional hearings earlier this month. DLA Piper did not respond to questions from PI at the time about Chambliss’ role. Equifax referred questions to Smith’s lawyers, who declined to comment.

MEANWHILE, IN THE CAYMAN ISLANDS: PI reported earlier this month that the Cayman Islands had hired Baker Botts to lobby on tax reform. The Cayman Compass’ editorial board seems to approve. “Cayman Islands officials acted wisely when they hired Baker Botts law firm partner Jeff Munk to represent our country’s interests in Washington, D.C.,” the news site wrote in an editorial on Friday. “Especially now, as the U.S. Congress prepares for a contentious debate about tax reform, it is imperative that Cayman ensures American policymakers have accurate information and meaningful context about our financial services sector and its critical role in the U.S. and global economy.”

DEMOCRATIC FUNDRAISING UPDATE: “The Democratic National Committee is reeling, facing a turnaround that's proving a much bigger lift than anyone expected as it struggles to raise enough money to cover its basic promises,” POLITICO’s Gabriel Debenedetti and Edward-Isaac Dovere report. “Many donors are refusing to write checks. And on-the-ground operatives worry they won’t have the resources to build the infrastructure they need to compete effectively in next year’s midterms and in the run-up to 2020. … 'Donors, small and large, are so over the party,' said Nebraska party chair Jane Kleeb, summing up the problem facing DNC chairman Tom Perez and his counterparts in the states.” Full story.

— The DNC may be struggling to raise cash, but Democratic House candidates, are “printing money,” in the words of one Republican operative, POLITICO’s Elena Schneider reports.

— Issue One, meanwhile, a Washington good-government group, criticized the DNC for forming a mammoth joint-fundraising committee called the Democratic Grassroots Victory Fund, which it estimated would be able to accept checks of more than $540,000 from each donor per year. “The Democratic Grassroots Victory Fund seems to be drawing a roadmap for how wealthy people can give more than half a million dollars a year in a single check to the political party of their choice,” Meredith McGehee, Issue One’s chief of policy, programs and strategy, said in a statement.

— “The Democratic Party and progressive organizations are witnessing robust grassroots enthusiasm with 70 percent of our contributions coming from people donating $200 or less,” Xochitl Hinojosa, a DNC spokeswoman, responded in a statement. “In addition, the DNC has created the Democratic Grassroots Victory Fund in partnership with State Parties that will fund the Every Zip Code Counts program, an unprecedented commitment to grassroots organizing through state parties, and other core party building.” She added: “The only way to win is to organize, and that’s exactly what we’re doing here."

IF YOU MISSED IT THIS WEEKEND: “For years, the Environmental Protection Agency has struggled to prevent an ingredient once used in stain-resistant carpets and nonstick pans from contaminating drinking water,” The New York Times’ Eric Lipton reports. “The chemical, perfluorooctanoic acid, or PFOA, has been linked to kidney cancer, birth defects, immune system disorders and other serious health problems. So scientists and administrators in the E.P.A.’s Office of Water were alarmed in late May when a top Trump administration appointee insisted upon the rewriting of a rule to make it harder to track the health consequences of the chemical, and therefore regulate it.”

— “The revision was among more than a dozen demanded by the appointee, Nancy B. Beck, after she joined the E.P.A.’s toxic chemical unit in May as a top deputy. For the previous five years, she had been an executive at the American Chemistry Council, the chemical industry’s main trade association. … The E.P.A.’s abrupt new direction on legacy chemicals is part of a broad initiative by the Trump administration to change the way the federal government evaluates health and environmental risks associated with hazardous chemicals, making it more aligned with the industry’s wishes.” Full story.

JOBS REPORT:

— CLS Strategies is bringing on Ruth Guerra as a managing director and Julia Sutherland as a senior adviser. Guerra was previously communications director for the Congressional Leadership Fund and its sister nonprofit, American Action Network, and before that worked for the Republican National Committee. Sutherland previously ran her own firm, Sutherland Consulting. CLS also added Elizabeth Kelley as a senior associate and promoted Dan Smith to managing associate from senior associate.

— Walter Suskind, a former spokesman for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, is joining Edelman’s financial communications and capital markets team. PI reported last week that Kalina Francis, a House Financial Service Committee aide, would join the team as well.
