A Georgia woman who was found dead in the trunk of her car was most likely lured by teenagers, her family said.

Toni Abad's body was found Friday morning after employees at a Waffle House in South Fulton County alerted police to a suspicious vehicle behind the restaurant.

When police arrived they noticed the driver's side window of the car was broken, WXIA reports. Officers then found the 58-year-old woman's body in the trunk.

De'asia Page and Jared Kemp, both 18, were arrested and charged with murder.

According to WSB-TV, surveillance video showed that Abad had been flagged down by a woman, believed to be Page, late Thursday as she was leaving work at Publix.

Abad's family and friends believe Page asked for a ride and led Abad to a location where Kemp was waiting.

The teens allegedly stole Christmas gifts Abad had bought for her grandchildren and then beat her before abandoning her car, her family said.

Sandra Scott, who works at Publix, told Fox 5 Atlanta that Page was seen asking for rides Thursday night.

Scott said Page approached her but she refused to give the teen a lift because she was afraid of giving a ride to a stranger.

"(Toni) wanted to do something to help them," she said.

Family members told the outlet in a statement that Abad was the "hardest working woman" they had ever met and had recently welcomed a fifth grandchild.

"This woman loved everyone else more than herself... She is survived by 4 sons and 5 grandchildren. My mother tried to see the good in people even when it was ill-advised but she was very loved and will not be forgotten," the statement read.

Police have yet to release a cause of death.

Kemp and Page, who investigators believe were homeless, are being held at the Fulton County Jail on murder charges. They have a scheduled court appearance on Jan. 9.
