A woman faces a murder charge after another woman died Saturday morning after being cut at a Fort Worth hotel.

Stephanie Renee Graham, 39, of Fort Worth was booked into Tarrant County jail Saturday and has since posted bond.


Police were called to a report of a disturbance at the Radisson hotel in the 2500 block of Meacham Boulevard around 1:20 a.m. Saturday. They found 43-year-old Jennifer Cobb of Fort Worth bleeding from an upper-body wound on a patio, spokesman Tracy Carter said.


Cobb died about an hour later at a hospital, according to the Tarrant County medical examiner's office.


Cobb was injured when Graham broke glass on her, police told the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.
