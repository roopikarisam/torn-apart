DETROIT (AP) — A disastrous Detroit-area jail project won’t be revived.

Wayne County said Friday that the partially finished eyesore near Ford Field won’t be completed. Instead, officials are pursuing plans for a criminal justice center a few miles north, off Interstate 75.

Rock Ventures is interested in the property, next to the courthouse. It has agreed to pay $500,000 to a construction company that submitted a plan to try to finish the jail.

County Executive Warren Evans says there was too much risk for the county to complete it.

Construction stopped in 2013 when Robert Ficano was county executive. The jail project was marred by millions in cost overruns and a lack of supervision over contractors.
