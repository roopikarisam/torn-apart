SALEM, Ore. (AP) — A woman who escaped from a Marion County transition center last week has been arrested after she was discovered in a stranger’s house.

The Statesman Journal reports Thursday that 29-year-old Mary Wisbey, of Salem, was originally to be released Friday but is now back in jail on charges of attempting to elude police and trespassing.

Wisbey had a week left on her sentence when she and another female inmate walked away from the transition center on May 31.

The other inmate, 26-year-old Mary Terwilleger, is still on the loose.

Wisbey was serving a sentence for a parole violation and had been previously arrested on theft and drug-related charges.

A man called police to report that a stranger was in his home.

Wisbey fled and arrested a little while later nearby.
