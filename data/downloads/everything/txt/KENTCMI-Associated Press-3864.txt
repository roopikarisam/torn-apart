SEATTLE (AP) â€” A murder suspect who was shot by a King County jail officer when he escaped from custody is facing robbery and escape charges.

Seattle Police say 19-year-old Giovanni Herrin was being guarded Wednesday by King County jail officers at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle when he managed to break free from his restraints. He bolted when one guard was briefly distracted and another was out of the room.

An officer wrote in a court document that Herrin ran several blocks, jumped into the backseat of a Lyft car, hit the driver in the head and eventually got out.

A jail officer shot and wounded him near downtown Seattle.

Herrin was charged last month in King County Superior Court with killing his girlfriend in Kent.

He's back in jail and made an initial court appearance Thursday.
