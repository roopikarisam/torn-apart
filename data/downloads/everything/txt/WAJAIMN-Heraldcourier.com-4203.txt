An elaborate scheme designed to allow a Southwest Virginia Regional Jail inmate to escape custody from a local hospital was thwarted by authorities and resulted in charges being placed against three people, the Washington County Sheriff’s Office said Thursday.


Inmate Faith Skipper, 29, of Glade Spring, has been charged with felony conspiracy assault on a correctional officer, felony conspiring with another prisoner to escape, felony attempt to escape and conspiracy of bomb threat. Another inmate, Carla Norris Allen, 37, of Meadowview, has been charged with felony conspiracy of bomb threat.


Samuel Blake Taylor, 28, of Bristol, Virginia, has been charged with felony conspiracy to aid in a prisoners escape, felony conspiracy of bomb threat and felony conspiracy assault on correctional officer.


Sheriff Fred Newman said authorities obtained information that led them to believe an escape could possibly be attempted while the inmate was receiving treatment outside the jail. Added manpower was used by jail staff and deputies until the inmate was returned to the jail without incident, Newman said in a news release Thursday.


Master Deputy Chris Brady further investigated the inmate’s phone calls that were made prior to the inmate being taken to the hospital. The investigation revealed a conspiracy and aid to escape from two other individuals, Newman said.


During the investigation, Newman said Brady obtained information that led them to believe the plan was to take a jail officer’s radio by choking or pepper-spraying her to keep her quiet until the inmates could make their getaway. Newman said the plan also indicated an attempt to divert law enforcement personnel to the Exit 29 area in Glade Spring by means of calling in a false bomb threat.


Phone calls placed several days after the hospital trip by the same inmate indicated another attempt at escaping and information found inside a letter showed it would be done from the jail, Newman said.


All three people are being held without bail at the Southwest Virginia Regional Jail in Abingdon. Court dates have been set for Wednesday.
