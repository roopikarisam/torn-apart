CHARLOTTE, N.C. (AP) — Police in North Carolina have arrested a prison officer and accused her of shooting a man in the back.

The Charlotte Observer reports the Rockingham Police Department says 34-year-old Erica Tamika Johnson is charged with attempted murder. Rockingham is 73 miles (117 km) east of Charlotte.

An arrest warrant says Johnson shot 61-year-old Remus Davis twice in the back and tried to shoot him in the head one week ago. Police say it’s unclear what prompted the incident.

Johnson, who has worked for the prison system since 2008, works as an officer at Lanesboro Correctional Institution. She is being held in the Richmond County jail.
