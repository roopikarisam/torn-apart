A Covington police officer assaulted on Christmas Eve is recovering at home thanks, at least in part, to the quick action of a U.S. Army medic who happened to be on the scene.


Covington police on Tuesday thanked Staff Sgt. Stewart A. Lee, who is home in Northern Kentucky on holiday leave from Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio.


"He was home for the holidays and thankfully was in the right place when this event happened," the police department wrote in a press release.

The officer, Brian Powers, received serious injuries during a scuffle while trying to arrest Antonio Ford, 33, of Newport, at 1:30 a.m. Christmas Eve morning, according to officials. Ford was wanted for fourth-degree assault when officers reported they spotted him in the 900-block of Madison Avenue. 


Ford attempted to flee, officials said, but was caught and remains in the Kenton County Detention Center on $50,000 bond. 


After the scuffle, Lee noticed Powers on the ground and "rendered first aid," the release said. Covington Police Chief Rob Nader told Fox19 Lee is a "Christmas blessing."


"We owe him a great deal; 1:30 in the morning, to take the time to help an officer while he's down, that's great," Nader said. "That just shows the community coming together."
