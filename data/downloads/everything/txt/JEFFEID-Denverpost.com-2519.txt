Joshua James Gonzales, a man arrested in connection with the beating of a toddler who was found unresponsive in her mother’s lap, appeared before a Jefferson County judge Friday morning.

Gonzales, 21, has been charged with one count of child abuse with a serious bodily injury. If convicted, he would face a mandatory prison sentence of 10-32 years, according to the First Judicial District Attorney’s Office. He remains in custody at the Jefferson County jail on a $100,000 bond.

Gonzales surrendered to authorities on Sept. 17. Investigators had been looking for him after a bystander called 911 to report an injured child outside Doull Elementary School. They discovered the girl lying in her mother Melissa Mangeri’s lap. Mangeri and Gonzales were dating.

The toddler had bruising on her genitals and elsewhere on her body, according to Gonzales’ arrest affidavit. She had a lacerated liver, severe head trauma and fractures to two ribs. She faced a substantial risk of death.

Mangeri told investigators that she and Gonzales had been arguing in the living room when the toddler began to cry, according to the affidavit. She said Gonzales yanked the girl’s arm, hit her and threw her against a couch. He then kicked her.

Gonzales’ preliminary hearing is Oct. 25.
