GLAAD announced initial celebrity participants for Spirit Day 2017. The annual initiative that inspires millions around the world to wear purple or ‘go purple’ online in a unified stand against bullying and to show support for LGBTQ youth. Spirit Day 2017 will take place tomorrow, Oct. 19.


According to GLAAD, musical talent confirmed to participate includes Britney Spears, Halsey, Christina Aguilera, Luis Fonsi, Celine Dion, Fergie, Olivia Newton-John, Monica, Wrabel, Callum Scott, Skylar Stecker and Zeke Thomas. Mario Lopez, Lily Tomlin and the hosts of MTV’s TRL will also go purple. More names will be announced on Spirit Day, tomorrow.






"It is so important that we all participate in things like GLAAD’s Spirit Day. If just to be visible," said Wrabel. "If one person that needs it sees a message of hope and love and acceptance, that's what it's about for me. It is such a scary time for so many. Now more than ever, we need to be loud and proud and visible."


Spirit Day began in 2010 after a high school student posted the idea to her Tumblr page following the suicide deaths of several LGBTQ and LGBTQ-perceived young people. According to GLSEN's most recent National School Climate Survey, 57.6 percent of LGBTQ students felt unsafe at school because of their sexual orientation and 43.3 percent because of their gender expression. GLSEN also reported that 85.2 percent of LGBTQ students experienced verbal harassment at school based on a personal characteristic.
