The reality TV couple, who appeared on MTV show Meet The Barkers for two seasons, split in 2008 after four years of an on-and-off marriage.

They share son Landon, 14, and daughter Alabama, 12.

In Barker’s 2015 memoir Can I Say, guest writer Moakler blamed the reality show on their relationship’s demise.

“I think the show destroyed our relationship,” Moakler writes, citing the drummer’s fear of losing his rock n’ roll identity. “I think he was afraid he was going to be looked on as a reality star. So when the cameras stopped rolling, he distanced himself from me in every way that he possibly could.”
