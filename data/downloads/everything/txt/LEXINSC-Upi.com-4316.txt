May 21 (UPI) -- South Carolina authorities are searching Monday for two accused killers who orchestrated an escape from their jail over the weekend, officials said.

The fugitives are two of three men who escaped from the Orangeburg, S.C., detention center on Saturday night. Officials said they overpowered a guard.


Police are searching for Tyshon Demontrea Johnson and Curtis Ray Green, each were being held on murder charges, Orangeburg County Sheriff Leroy Ravenell said.

One of the three was ultimately captured. Christopher Bolin, 27, who'd been jailed on charges of carjacking and stolen vehicle possession, was caught Sunday.

Bolin was captured after Lexington County law enforcement officers learned that he had contacts in the county, Ravenell said.
