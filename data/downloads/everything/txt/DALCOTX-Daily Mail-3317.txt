Mary Harrison, 47, shot her husband Dexter, 49, on Saturday in their Dallas home

A Texas woman admitted to shooting dead her husband because he was beating the family cat, according to police.


Mary Harrison, 47, was arrested for killing her husband Dexter, 49, at their Dallas home Saturday morning just before 7am.  


When officers arrived to the scene, Harrison told police she and her husband were arguing and he had been beating the family's cat. 


She admitted to shooting her husband, authorities said. 


Dexter was rushed to Presbyterian Hospital where he was pronounced dead. 


Harrison was arrested and booked into the Lew Sterrett Justice Center where she is being held on $100,000 bail. 


She now faces murder charges.  


Neighbors told KTCT-TC that the couple and their two teenage sons had moved into the duplex in northeast Dallas just months ago. 


They also said the cat recently went missing and the wife posted signs around the neighborhood but eventually returned. 


'A man got shot over a cat? It's kind of crazy. It's unbelievable,' neighbor Carl Phillips told the local station. 


'A man loses his life over a cat. I mean, people love their pets, but it ain't that serious… to die for a cat,' he added.  


When police arrived to their Dallas home, she admitted that she shot him because he was beating the family cat
