Roman Clay, 20, of Lancaster, was charged Thursday with burglarizing five apartments on New Year's Day.

A Lancaster man who served less than 30 days in jail on felony burglary charges three months ago has been sentenced to 90 days in jail for violating his parole, court records show.


Roman Clay, 22, was charged with DUI on Aug. 18 in Kentucky.


On Wednesday, Lancaster County President Judge Dennis Reinaker found the charge to be a violation of Clay's parole.


Reinaker sentenced Clay to one to 23 months in prison in May for breaking into five residences near Millersville University on New Year's Day in 2016. In some instances, people were awakened to find Clay in their home.


The sentence included six years of probation and 100 hours of community service. Clay served less than 30 days in prison.


Lancaster County District Attorney Craig Stedman immediately called the sentence too lenient and has challenged the sentence through the state Superior Court. The appeal is still pending, court dockets show.

Sentencing guidelines called for a minimum one-year sentence for each of the five burglary charges, Stedman argued at the time.


A former football standout at Lancaster Catholic High School, Clay is enrolled in a graduate program at Murray State University in Kentucky and was a member of its football team.


He was dismissed from the team shortly after his DUI arrest,Â according to Kentucky media reports.


Clay is currently held at Lancaster County Prison.
