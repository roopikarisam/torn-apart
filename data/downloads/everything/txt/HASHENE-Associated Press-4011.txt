JACKSON, Miss. (AP) â€” Mississippi inmates with at least a year of good behavior are being rewarded by having relatives visit them in prison.

The state Department of Corrections says in a news release that up to 100 women and 90 men are being allowed to receive visitors Saturday inside Central Mississippi Correctional Facility in Rankin County.

Each inmate can visit with three children and one adult from a list of approved guests.

Corrections Commissioner Pelicia E. Hall says prison officials believe family visitation has helped reduce the number of inmates cited for fighting and other problems.

Hall says she commends the prison staff for coming up with "programs that cost little to no money to improve rehabilitation and re-entry for inmates."
