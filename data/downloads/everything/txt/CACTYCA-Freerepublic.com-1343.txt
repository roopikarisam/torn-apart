Zain Jaffer, 29, was the CEO of Vungle, a mobile video ad company he founded in 2011. But Jaffer was removed of his CEO duties after his arrest earlier this week. 


The 29-year-old was initially booked with felony charges for attempted murder, a lewd act on a child, oral copulation of a person under 14, child abuse, assault with a deadly weapon and a misdemeanor charge for battery upon an officer and emergency personnel. The attempted murder charge has since been dropped due to a lack of evidence. 


Vungle, which has big-name investors including Google, issued the following statement about Jaffer: 


While we do not have any information that is not in the public record at this point, these are extremely serious allegations, and we are shocked beyond words. While these are only preliminary charges, they are obviously so serious that it led to the immediate removal of Mr. Jaffer from any operational responsibility at the company. The company stressed that this matter has nothing to do with Mr. Jaffers former role at the company. 


According to reports, police were called to Jaffers home early Sunday morning. When they arrived, they were greeted by Jaffers father who told them to go to the backyard. Thats where police allegedly found Jaffer naked attempting to commit the sexual assault of a 3-year-old child. 


When police approached Jaffer, its reported that he wrapped the toddler in his legs and began choking the child. It took multiple officers to pull the victim away from Jaffer. 


A 1-year-old was also found at the location. The child had bruises throughout its body. 


Jaffer was arrested on Sunday and arraigned on Tuesday, and his next court date is November 1. He is currently being held on bail at the Maple Street Correctional Center in Redwood City, California. Jaffers attorney told NBC News that his client is not guilty. 


It is believed that Jaffer may have been using drugs at the time of the assault, according to NBC News.

Want to bed which party and candidates this guy has given oodles of money to?

The party of slimeballs (inthis case I mean the democrats).

More than 30 women accuse Hollywood director James Toback of sexual assault in disturbing accounts of him ‘coercing them to his hotel rooms, dry-humping them and masturbating in front of them’

A solid Democrat...

Im not seeing anything at FEC.gov regarding political donations from this guy.

My God. Were they his own children? I cannot fathom this type of depravity.

Yet another depraved pervert LIB in a string of many. There will be many more.




Thank God we have a president who will read such a story and realize how correct he is about doing everything possible to minimize immigration from the Middle East.

Don’t forget to mention the perp is a Muslim.

Prison will be hell for him, until the other prisoners kill him.

Since the gender of the “child” is not mentioned, we must (as when the race of a criminal is not mentioned) make a certain assumption.

God bless that righteous father. His son Didu Sumpin.


If the father knew, though, why didnt he stop him?

It's possible that the perp had taken one of those horrible drugs that gives superhuman strength. Cops have had to taze people repeatedly to subdue them when they are under the influence. Also, the article pointed out that the perp used the one child as a human shield, threatening to strangle it, when the cops did arrive. So his own older father with no training did the only thing he knew to do -- call in the experienced officers.
