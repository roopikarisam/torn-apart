Thirteen accused drug traffickers appeared in Federal Court for a hearing related to a multi-county drug bust that involves twenty iNDividuals.


Several of the defendants were arrested in a major operation Thursday, while others were already in jail on other charges.


Law enforcement has been working since January of this year to find all of the suspects related to the case. They arrested fifteen of the twenty on Thursday.


All suspects are charged with conspiracy to distribute and possess with the intent to distribute controlled substances. Specifically, cocaine, methamphetamine and marijuana.


In total, agents reported they found a pound of cocaine, five pounds of pot, five guns, two vehicles and one recreational vehicle.


U.S. Attorney, Erin Nealy Cox, called it an example of the amazing results that have come and will come from uniting federal, state and local law enforcement in fighting drug trafficking in West Texas. She said the 'One mission, one team' approach to narcotics, violent crime and gang enforcement will help agents produce exceptional results for the people of the South Plains.


A Federal Grand Jury indicts Jose Garcia Lizanaga, Ambrosio Garcia Jr. and Ambrosio Garcia-Rodriguez Sr. on counts of distribution and possession with intent to distribute 500 grams or more of cocaine.


Garcia-Lizanaga, Jorge Lizarrago-Tirado and Broderick Bradley face counts of distribution and possession with intent to distribute cocaine.


Saul Cavira-Moina, Jermaine Garmon, Shad Evans and Arturo Sanchez face charges of possession with intent to distribute cocain.


Bradley is charged with distribution and possession with intent to distribute twenty-eight grams or more of cocaine base.


Garcia-Lizanaga, Richard Hupper and Andrew Pugh are facing counts of distribution and possession with intent to distribute 500 grams or more of meth.


Robert Lee Melendez has one count of distribution and possession with intent to distribute pot.


Garcia-Lizanaga, Lizarraga-Tirado, Eduardo Cruz, Melendez, Jesus Franco and Juana Sanchez have counts of unlawful use of a communication facility. Agents say they used cell phones to help the trafficking operation.


Petra Sauceda-Perez has one count of bulk cash smuggling.


Garcia-Lizanaga, Lizarraga-Tirado and Garmon will be put in temporary detention while they await their ten day contingency. It's tentatively set for July 2nd.


The U.S. Government believes Lizarraga-Tirado is in the country illegally. 


The rest of the defendants will appear for their motion to detain next Wednesday (6/27).
