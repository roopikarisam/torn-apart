RNA polymerase III (Pol III) and transcription factor IIIB (TFIIIB) assemble together on different promoter types to initiate the transcription of small, structured RNAs. Here we present structures of Pol III preinitiation complexes, comprising the 17-subunit Pol III and the heterotrimeric transcription factor TFIIIB, bound to a natural promoter in different functional states. Electron cryo-microscopy reconstructions, varying from 3.7 Å to 5.5 Å resolution, include two early intermediates in which the DNA duplex is closed, an open DNA complex, and an initially transcribing complex with RNA in the active site. Our structures reveal an extremely tight, multivalent interaction between TFIIIB and promoter DNA, and explain how TFIIIB recruits Pol III. Together, TFIIIB and Pol III subunit C37 activate the intrinsic transcription factor-like activity of the Pol III-specific heterotrimer to initiate the melting of double-stranded DNA, in a mechanism similar to that of the Pol II system.

RNA polymerase III (Pol III) catalyses the transcription of short RNAs, including transfer RNAs and the 5S ribosomal RNA, which are essential for protein synthesis during cell growth. Pol III is predominantly regulated at the level of transcription initiation, and dysregulated Pol III activity is linked to diseases including cancer. Two independent studies in this issue, by Alessandro Vannini and colleagues and Christoph Müller and colleagues, describe electron cryo-microscopy structures of the yeast Pol III preinitiation complex, comprising the full 17-subunit Pol III and the three TFIIIB subunits (TBP, Brf1 and Bdp1) bound to promoter DNA in various functional states. The structures reveal the detailed mechanisms that underlie how Pol III is recruited to its target promoters and how promoter DNA is opened to form a stable transcription bubble, and also allow a comparison with the structures of Pol I and Pol II preinitiation complexes.
