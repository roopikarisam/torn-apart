LANESBOROUGH, Mass. (AP) â€” Several people have been hospitalized in a head-on collision with a car transporting bees in western Massachusetts.

The Berkshire Eagle reports five people, including a 4-year-old boy, have been taken to Berkshire Medical Center following a crash in Lanesborough Saturday.

Police responded to the scene shortly before 2 p.m. to find a Ford station wagon carrying hundreds of bees and a Chevrolet Sedan had crashed.

Police say the collision was at least somewhat caused by bees getting loose and stinging the driver. Several people on the scene were stung, but none were hospitalized for their stings.

The beekeeper refused to be taken to the hospital for evaluation and tried to collect the bees into several hives.
