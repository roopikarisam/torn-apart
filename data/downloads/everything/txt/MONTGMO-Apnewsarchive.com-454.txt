DAYTON, Ohio (AP) â€” The family of an Ohio man who died in jail is suing authorities because they say he didn't get needed medical attention.

The lawsuit says 49-year-old Robert Linkous died of heart failure in 2015 after spending a day in the Montgomery County jail in Dayton.

His wife says she called 911 because he needed medical help at home but instead police took him to jail and held him on two years-old warrants.

The lawsuit says Linkous was suffering from alcohol and heroin withdrawal, a heart condition, high blood pressure and a confused mental state.


A county spokeswoman declined to comment on the lawsuit and the Dayton Daily News reports the sheriff and police didn't respond to messages seeking comment.
