Dozens of demonstrators, taking aim at how the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality has handled water quality permitting for a pair of controversial natural gas pipelines, blockaded the agency’s office in downtown Richmond during a peaceful protest Thursday afternoon.

After about an hour, a representative of the owner of the building DEQ leases at Seventh and East Main streets asked the protesters to leave.

They refused, and police gently led away 19 protesters who had lined up along the building and volunteered themselves for arrest. They were issued summonses for “obstruction of free passage,” a Class 1 misdemeanor that carries a maximum fine of $2,500 and up to a year in jail.

“I think the police were just great,” said Clarke Herbert, a 68-year-old retired school teacher from Alexandria who was among the protesters police took, without using handcuffs or other restraints, to the hood of a squad car for their summonses. “I tried to discuss the issue with them and of course they don’t do that. But they handled everything very courteously and considerately.”

The downtown protest, which began at the Capitol Bell Tower, was the second of two days of demonstrations at DEQ offices statewide spearheaded by the Chesapeake Climate Action Network, a nonprofit that fights global warming. The rallies were organized by the group’s action fund, which also will help cover legal costs for the protesters arrested.

Police closed Main Street for several blocks during the demonstration, which included chants such as “Water is life; water is a human right,” “Terry, stop the pipelines,” and “DEQ, shame on you if you let these permits through.”

Richmond Police spokeswoman Koury Wilson called the demonstration “an ideal peaceful protest.”

DEQ has said it intends to certify that construction of both the Atlantic Coast and Mountain Valley pipelines will not violate state water quality standards. Agency staff are sorting through thousands of responses received during a recent public comment period and will be sending a recommendation to the State Water Control Board, which is expected to vote on the certifications later this year.

James Golden, the agency’s director of operations, was watching the protests Thursday but wouldn’t comment. The agency has said it is going to the limits of its authority in assembling the water quality certifications.

Dominion Energy’s 600-mile Atlantic Coast Pipeline will run from West Virginia through the heart of Virginia to North Carolina, with an extension to the Hampton Roads area. The 303-mile Mountain Valley Pipeline, developed by EQT Midstream Partners, will run from West Virginia to southern Virginia.

For months, DEQ has been under mounting criticism for how it has handled the water quality certifications, including misleading public statements that the agency would review each of the hundreds of spots where the pipelines will cross waterways.

Instead, the DEQ will rely on a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers permit for those crossings and focus its efforts on upland areas and a review of the pipeline developers’ plans to control erosion, storm water and sediment. That plan review is being performed by a contractor working for Dominion on an unrelated project, another sore spot for pipeline opponents.

Environmental groups want Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who was an early cheerleader for the pipelines, and the Water Control Board to reject the approvals and block the pipeline. In New York, the state Department of Environmental Conservation denied a water-quality certification for the 121-mile Constitution Pipeline between Pennsylvania and New York. That decision was upheld last month by a federal court of appeals. And last week, West Virginia’s environmental agency said it would vacate the water quality certification it issued for the Mountain Valley Pipeline for re-evaluation after it was challenged in court, the Roanoke Times reported.

Joan Wages, 56, of Roanoke, who was last in the line of protesters to get a summons Thursday, says she has many neighbors and friends whose property will be affected by the Mountain Valley Pipeline.

“I’m concerned about the taking of land for private gain,” Wages said. “To me, Gov. McAuliffe’s support of these pipelines is unconscionable. We’re paying taxes to our government officials so they can rubber stamp things so corporations can make money. That needs to stop.”
