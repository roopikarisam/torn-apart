A 44-year-old Eugene man will be arraigned in Portland Monday in connection with the 2017 shooting death of a man who was found suffering from gunshot wounds in Southeast Portland, the Portland Police Bureau reported Saturday.

Lorenzo L. Jones was arrested Friday on an arrest warrant. Eugene police took him into custody following a traffic stop. He was taken to Portland, and lodged in the Multnomah County Jail.

He had been sought in connection with the death of Wilbert Butler, 27.

On Sept. 17, police were sent to the 3600 block of S.E. 28th Avenue. Butler, who was from Eugene, was taken to the hospital, where he later died.
