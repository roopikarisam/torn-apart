        Dear Reader,
        
        As you can imagine, more people are reading The Jerusalem Post than ever before.
            Nevertheless, traditional business models are no longer sustainable and high-quality publications,
            like ours, are being forced to look for new ways to keep going. Unlike many other news organizations,
            we have not put up a paywall. We want to keep our journalism open
            and accessible and be able to keep providing you with news
            and analyses from the frontlines of Israel, the Middle East and the Jewish World.
    

As one of our loyal readers, we ask you to be our partner.

For $5 a month you will receive access to the following:

Help us grow and continue telling Israel’s story to the world.

Thank you,


        Ronit Hasin-Hochman, CEO, Jerusalem Post Group
        Yaakov Katz, Editor-in-Chief
    


            MIAMI – The celebration began in Ben-Gurion Airport’s spacious King David  Lounge, where El Al staff, passengers and well-wishers toasted the airline’s new  direct flight to the southeastern Florida city with champagne and blue-and-white  marshmallows.Looking down from my plum perch on the second floor –  conveniently situated next to the scotch bar – I wondered how I would get  through the 14-hour ride.
