Seton Hall Sports

The first weekend of college basketball is in the books, and No. 23 Seton Hall did just about everything that was expected of it in two walkover wins against New Jersey foes, as both Fairleigh Dickinson and Monmouth fell to the Pirates. Here is what we learned from the two victories.

The biggest plus of the weekend may have been Myles Powell's excellent play. The sophomore shooting guard had 18 points against Monmouth and 10 points against Fairleigh Dickinson. His 3-point shooting will be essential once again for Seton Hall, for which outside shooting isn't a strength. He also looks to be in excellent shape, even more so than last year when he dropped 40 pounds before the season started.
