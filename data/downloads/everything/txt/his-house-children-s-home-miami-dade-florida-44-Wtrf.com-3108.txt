In Ohio, the public can't find out the home address or personal phone number of a prosecutor or a Childrens Services worker.


That's to protect them from angry or disgruntled individuals.


Oddly enough, that same protection is not in place for a judge.


Now, after the attempted murder of Judge Joseph Bruzzese of Jefferson County, State Representative Jack Cera has sponsored a bill to extend that protection to judges and magistrates.


"In this day and age,  you never know when an individual is going to be upset," said Rep. Cera. "And judges certainly impact lives when they sentence people who have done wrong. So it's important to protect their personal information. It gives them the ability to keep their personal phone numbers and their home addresses away from the public."


Cera says the bill passed out of committee unanimously, and he hopes it will move to the House floor in January.


He says lawmakers wondered how judges were not included in these protections in the first place.


It actually would not have protected Judge Bruzzese, who was shot outside the courthouse, not outside his home.


But Cera says it offers at least some level of protection.
