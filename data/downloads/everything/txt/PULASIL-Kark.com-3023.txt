LITTLE ROCK, Ark. - Memphis rapper Ricky Hampton, 25, aka Finese2Tymes, is back in jail in Arkansas.


A check of the Pulaski County Regional Detention Facility website shows he was booked in on Thursday evening.


His jail record notes a charge of Possession of Firearms by Certain Persons, as well as a hold for U.S. Marshals and a Fugitive charge from Shelby County (Memphis).


Finese2Tymes was the rapper who was performing during the Power Ultra Lounge mass shooting in July 2017.


He was later jailed in eastern Arkansas in connection to a shooting at a club there.


Just last month, the Little Rock Police Department announced it had obtained warrants for the arrest of Hampton's bodyguard 


Cordero Ragland, 26, was jailed in Tennessee at that time and was to be extradited to Arkansas.
