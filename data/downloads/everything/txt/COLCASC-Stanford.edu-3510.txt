Measuring the Adaptation of Countries to Societal Aging

Register Now! [Reception to follow]

With  global aging,  increasing attention has been drawn to ways in which various
                           countries may be adapting (or not) to the increases in their population of older persons.
                           Such adaptations occur across many sectors of society, including social and financial
                           supports, health care, labor force and the like. The Network on an Aging Society has
                           developed a multi-sectoral Index of Societal Aging which provides a quantitative measure
                           of the degree to which a country is adapting with respect to several factors of central
                           importance to the capacity individuals to age successfully.  This Index can be used
                           to estimate the effect of current and future policy changes and facilitates cross
                           national comparisons.
