More than a dozen men — one sporting a skull mask and another carrying a large stick — were involved in a gang-fueled clash in Queens that left one man stabbed to death, cops said Saturday.

Two other men were wounded during the skirmish at Seneca Ave. and Palmetto St. in Ridgewood shortly after 9 p.m. Friday.

Cops responding to the fight found Daniel Atkinson, 24, stabbed in the stomach. Medics rushed him to Wyckoff Hospital, but he could not be saved.

A 26-year-old man with Atkinson had been stabbed repeatedly about the body, cops said. A third man, 23, had been stabbed in the head and back. Both were taken to Elmhurst Hospital, where they were listed in stable condition Saturday.

Cops released surveillance footage Saturday showing the brawlers passing a Latin restaurant about two blocks from the attack and asked the public's help identifying the crew, all believed to be in their 20s.

Anyone with information is asked to call Crime Stoppers at (800) 577-TIPS.
