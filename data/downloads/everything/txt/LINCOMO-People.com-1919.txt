“Austin is dead because of an action that took place, so until something steers us in another direction, we’re going to work it as a homicide,” Dougherty told reporters.

According to investigators, the crossbow arrow was fired at Austin, and traveled through his body before next striking his younger brother, who was standing behind him.
