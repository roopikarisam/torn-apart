ATLANTA (AP) — Atlanta police say a crowd protesting a U.S. immigration policy that separated children from their parents had become violent and one person was arrested.

Maj. Rick Mason tells news outlets that roughly 50 demonstrators were gathered Sunday night at the Atlanta City Detention Center. He says a group of officers had asked the protesters to remove tents they were erecting outside the city jail downtown.

Mason says the protesters refused to move the tents and that when officers approached to clear them, the crowd started fighting and throwing frozen water bottles at them.

Police did not name the woman who was arrested over a city ordinance violation but say she was charged with disorderly conduct.

Police say they would allow the protest to continue as long as it remains peaceful.
