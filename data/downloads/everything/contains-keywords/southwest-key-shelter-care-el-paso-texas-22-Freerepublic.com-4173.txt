Southwest Key Programs has received many hundreds of millions of dollars in federal funding to house children who arrived in the US illegally. 


Their detention center is located in a converted former Wal-Mart in Brownsville, Texas. It is staffed through local temporary agencies, while its executives draw salaries in the high 6-figures. Southwest Key Programs Inc is run by Dr. Juan Sanchez, who is a member of the National Board of La Raza and asks detainee children to address him as "El Presidente" 


Southwest Key Programs Inc recently refused access to a US Senator, and are now facing increased scrutiny.

From Glassdoor, about Southwest Key Programs Inc. (recipient of millions of federal tax dollars):

Worst and most traumatic experience in my professional career!
Former Employee - Clinician in Houston, TX

Negative Outlook
Disapproves of CEO

I worked at Southwest Key Programs full-time (More than 3 years)

Pros

The youth and families who I was able to work with.

Cons

The truth about Southwest Keys and the bullies within it is clear as day in reading the reviews given here alone. Protect yourself and dont work here. This nonprofit is poorly managed, money hungry &amp; quite frankly very shady.

I chose to leave my position with Southwest Keys because I could no longer sit in silence and be passive in an environment that was unstable, corrupt and toxic and I am beyond grateful that I got out of there when I did! Instead of dealing with the ill equipped and unprofessional individuals who run this organization, I am able to make a difference in my clients lives. While employed with Southwest Keys, my salary was under $40,000 a year. I struggled financially and was barely making it and I have a Masters degree and am licensed in the state of Texas. Now I earn a salary that I can live and thrive on and my value, worth and skills as a professional are appreciated in ways that Southwest Keys refused to do. I did my job and I did it well but I ultimately left because I was no longer going to be bullied into doing things that were not right and because Southwest Keys is not worth risking my license and the career that Ive worked hard for.

Many of the people who currently work in leadership positions were at one time in lower level positions. The sad part is that they seem to have lost touch with the insight they gained while in those positions and have forgotten how to treat people in a kind, compassionate and supportive manner. The way upper management handles issues within the company is similar to the kind of behavior you receive from a group of bullies who pick and choose who they want around and in their clique. As long as you comply, stay quiet, never ask questions or try to hold them accountable, you will remain on their good side. However, once you point something out that is wrong with the way they operate you immediately become a target &amp; upper management will make your work life absolutely miserable! Those in charge will use you &amp; abuse you for as long as you allow them too. They will break your spirit &amp; make you feel insignificant, unworthy, &amp; alone. They couldnt care less about whether your manager/program director is breaking rules, placing the program at risk of legal action or treating you poorly. They like to say they do but when in comes down to it, everyone from HR, corporate management, the Regional Executive director, &amp; program directors, will do everything in their power to punish you for speaking up &amp; protect themselves. When they want you gone they will find a way to push you out including giving false &amp; inaccurate performance reviews, withholding bonus &amp; writing you up for absurd reasons.

Southwest Key is notorious for high employee turnover because they dont take care of their people. Good, quality employees who are passionate &amp; know what they are doing eventually see past all of the smoke &amp; mirrors and realize that Southwest Key isnt all about familia like they claim it is. The number of red flags and unethical practices that take place within this organization is alarming and at some point will catch up with them. Work somewhere that you are valued and treated like the asset you are. Work somewhere that recognizes the people who want to do things the right way rather than cut corners to make money because that is all they care about here.Show Less

Advice to Management

Those of you in management positions need to recognize that you are not invincible. The employees working the hardest are not working to please you because you are not the focus. Its about the kids! Get off the power trip and wake up because its the kids that end up suffering for your inadequacy. An internal investigation into the organizations policies as well as a re-evaluation for those in upper management positions should be conducted ASAP. Not only would that show how under qualified these individuals are but it will also show the unethical and disgusting behaviors that should have led to your removal a long time ago!

Glassdoor.com critical reviews from Southwest Key Program Inc employees:

https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Southwest-Key-Programs-Reviews-E197985.htm

Reports were aired on Chris Hayes’ MSNBC show, alleging mistreatment of the children at Southwest Key facilities.

According to Hayes’ twitter feed, Southwest Key Programs Inc is asking for time on his program for a rebuttal.

https://twitter.com/chrislhayes/status/1007751258046914566

Comments on twitter are quite harsh, such as asking why a $770,000 salary is appropriate for the head of a non-profit (referring to Dr. Juan Sanchez, whose programs are 98% funded by government grants). Perhaps not coincidentally, Dr. Sanchez is also a member of the National Board of La Raza.
