Recipients include sports stars, celebs, and politicans, as well as hundreds of community champions recognised for the work they do in their local area


More than a thousand people have been recognised for their services to the UK in the Queen's New Year Honours list.

Recipients include sports stars, celebs, and politicans, as well as hundreds of community champions recognised for the work they do in their local area.

Bee Gee Barry Gibb was made a Sir, alongside Beatle Ringo Starr, while Strictly’s Darcey Bussell was made a Dame.

But the list was not without controversy, as Theresa May rewarded her political allies – with a Tory MP who holds power over her future winning a knighthood.

Here are some of the big names who'll be dressing up for a trip to see The Queen - plus a full list of all those getting a gong.

In total, 1,123 people where given awards this year, with 318 getting a BEM, 452 an MBE, and 211 an OBE. The rest were given other awards,such as knighthoods or damehoods, or other honours.

Around 70% of the recipients were recognised for their work in their local community, in either a voluntary or paid capacity..

There were 551 women recognised, representing 49% of the total. Just over 9% of recipients were from a BAME background, and 5% consider themselves to have a disability.

Around 11% of the awards are for work in education, while health sector recipients make up 10% of all honours.

The list of sports stars - who make up 4% of gongs - is smaller than last year when the New Year Honours were dominated by heroes from the Rio Olympics

Former Beatle Ringo Starr is to be knighted, 52 years after receiving an MBE and 20 years after bandmate Paul McCartney became a Sir.

The 77-year-old drummer , who Sir Paul famously urged the Queen to honour, said it was a “pleasure” to be recognised for his music and charity work telling fans: “Peace and love.”

Strictly Come Dancing judge Darcey Bussell said she was “truly humbled” by her damehood, awarded for her services to dance.

She added: “Dance is such a beautiful art form, it is inspiring and provides joy, social cohesion and wellbeing.”

The 48-year-old, who was the youngest-ever principal at the Royal Ballet aged just 20, said she’d accept the gong on behalf of dance groups everywhere.

Bee Gees star Barry Gibb was knighted for services to music and charity.

The “humbled and proud” star paid a touching tribute to his brothers and bandmates Maurice and Robin, who died in 2003 and 2012 - saying they deserved his knighthood.

The last surviving member of the band added: “I want to acknowledge how responsible my brothers are for this honour. It is as much theirs as it is mine.

“The magic, the glow, and the rush will last me the rest of my life.”

This Morning host and ‘King of Breakfast TV’ Eamonn Holmes receivedan OBE for services to broadcasting.

The 58-year-old television stalwart and journalist from Belfast is known for hosting GMTV, This Morning and Sky News' Sunrise across his nearly four decades on the box.

He said: "It's like getting a gold star for your homework - 2018 will be my 38th year as a broadcaster and I can't think of a better way of marking that. It's a wonderful accolade."

He said his wife Ruth “was even more thrilled than I was” as he said: “I did it on my own merits and worked very hard.”

Heather Knight heads a string of England women’s cricketers winning gongs after their thrilling victory in this year’s World Cup.

The captain, who turned 27 this week, is made an OBE after her team beat India by just nine runs in a stunning fightback at Lords in July.

Women’s cricket director Clare Connor is made a CBE and head coach Mark Robinson an OBE while MBEs go to star players Tamsin Beaumont and Anya Shrubsole.

Grime star Wiley has said receiving an MBE in the New Years Honours is like "the school grade I wanted and didn't get" but added he is now "finally there".

The musician, whose real name is Richard Cowie, and who is often referred to as the godfather of grime, is being honoured for his services to music.

Sam Warburton is rewarded for a rugby career spanning more than a decade.

The 29-year-old became the second man ever to captain the British and Irish Lions twice when he led their tour to New Zealand this year.

And he was credited as Wales’ youngest ever World Cup captain before he led the team to the semi-finals in 2011 and quarter-finals in 2015.

He picks up an OBE for services to rugby union, which was awarded under his full name, Sam Kennedy-Warburton.

Former Liberal Democrat leader and ex-Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has been knighted for political and public service.

The move has angered UKIP supporters after their former leader Nigel Farage was snubbed again.

The Lib Dems’ new deputy leader Jo Swinson has been made a CBE.

Theresa May risks a damaging new cronyism row after the MP who holds her survival in his hands won a knighthood.

Graham Brady, chairman of the powerful 1922 Committee, will become Sir Graham in the New Year Honours just three months after throwing his weight behind the Prime Minister.

Knighthoods and damehoods also go to veteran Tory MPs Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, Cheryl Gillan and Christopher Chope – all three of whom have held top posts in the backbenchers’ pressure group.

Organ donation campaigner Lucia Mee, 18, was the youngest person on the list this year.

Lucia, from Ballycastle, Co Antrim, was just eight when she suffered acute liver failure and was rushed to hospital for a transplant.

Since then she went under the knife twice more after the first organ was rejected and the second hit complications.

Yet she has founded the Live Loudly Donate Proudly campaign, competed at the British Transplant Games and returned to school

Lucia said she was “really shocked” by her British Empire Medal and admitted: “I didn’t know what the award was to begin with. My dad had to explain it to me.”

The oldest to receive honours are both 101 - Lt Col Mordaunt Cohen , whose MBE is for services to Second World War education, and Helen Jones who won a British Empire Medal for services to young people in Brecon.
