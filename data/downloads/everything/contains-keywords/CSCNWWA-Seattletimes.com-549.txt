Nina Shapiro’s piece on immigration courts was accurate and important. I attended a deportation hearing for the father of my daughter’s friend at the Northwest Detention Center in Tacoma last year. It was sobering and heartbreaking.

The building is buried in an industrial zone of semi-trucks and potholes. The judge’s description of an “alternate legal universe” captures well the surreal experience. I locked up my belongings as the staff chatted about colonoscopies and the weather while scanning anxious relatives through a metal detector. Inside the next room, dozens of pages of names taped to a wall listed the day’s hearings.

In ours, the judge appeared via a monitor from California, with the government’s attorney on another screen from Texas, looking bored. Our friend was one of the fortunate few to have an attorney and supporters attesting to the valuable community role he plays. We were stunned and elated when the judge granted a cancellation of removal. But I continue to think about the more than 1,000 inside — 79 percent of whom won’t be so lucky.

Destroying the lives of people with hopes and dreams like all of us, who contribute greatly to our society, is cruel and inhumane.
