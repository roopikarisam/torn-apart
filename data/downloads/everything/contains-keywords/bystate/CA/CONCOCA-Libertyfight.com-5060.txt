Every year people come to the United States seeking protection because they have suffered persecution or fear that they will suffer persecution due to:

Race

Religion

Nationality

Membership in a particular social group

Political opinion


I wonder if people like Jeremy Bedford Turner (in jail for saying that there is  "Jewish control" in the  UK), or holocaust skeptics Monika Schaefer and  Ursula Haverbeck (both currently imprisoned in Europe), Catholic  Bishop Richard Williamson, (who was previously arrested for a TV interview he did in which he cast doubt on the 'gas chambers' - you can watch this video below);  or even UK 
political commentators  
 Mark Collett or Andrew Carrington Hitchcock... 
Can any of these people get asylum in the U.S.  based on their fear of prosecution for their controversial political opinions? WHY NOT??!


Recall that the late 
Ernst Zundel not only was not granted asylum, but he was nabbed by U.S.  homeland security while living peacefully with his elderly American wife in Tennessee, with no due process, handed over to the Canadian government and tortured for years in solitary confinement as a 'national security risk,' then extradited  to Germany  for thought crimes, where he was locked in prison for years more. [I conducted an exclusive interview with Ernst Zundel's lawyer last year on this matter, here.]

Good righteous people who actually qualify for asylum based on the stated criteria don't actually get it.
