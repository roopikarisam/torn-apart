The Contra Costa County Sheriff’s Office is investigating complaints of abuse by federal immigration detainees at the West County Detention Facility in Richmond.

The complaints, first reported in The Chronicle, said female inmates were being denied books, shampoo and toilet paper and told to use bags when they need to go to the bathroom.

In a Facebook post, the office of Sheriff David Livingston said those allegations — reported in a series of Chronicle columns — were misleading. 

“We have not directly received any complaints from the female ICE detainees regarding the conditions at WCDF,” the post said. It went on to say that inmates have keys to their cells and are free to leave for medical appointments, visits, programs or to use the restroom.

The rooms are unlocked for most of the day, said the post, which was published late Thursday. 

“Still, we do take the ICE detainees’ claims seriously and have launched a full investigation,” it concluded.

Contra Costa County has a $6 million-a-year contract with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement to house male and female immigration detainees at the Richmond jail. Complaints about mistreatment, ranging from withholding of toiletries to lockdowns that last for hours, were documented in a September letter to the San Francisco activist group Community Initiatives for Visiting Immigrants in Confinement. 

The letter, signed by 27 inmates, has raised concerns among state leaders.

State Sen. Nancy Skinner, D-Berkeley, sent a letter to California Attorney General Xavier Beccera urging him to probe the conditions at the jail. Rep. Mark DeSaulnier, D-Concord, scheduled a tour of the jail for Nov. 27.
