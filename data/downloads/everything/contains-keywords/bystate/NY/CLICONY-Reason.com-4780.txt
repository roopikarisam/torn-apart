TIM REID/REUTERS/NewscomGood results Tuesday for both GOP and Democrats. Yesterday marked the most crowded primary day of the 2018 election, with eight states voting on candidates for Congress, governorships, and more. Elections took place in Alabama, California, Iowa, Mississippi, Montana, New Jersey, New Mexico, and South Dakota.

The bottom line, according to The Hill: "In critical races across the country, Democrats had a good night. But so too did Republicans, who avoided a disaster that could have cost them several seats in the House."

Making some of the most headlines was a judge recall vote in Santa Clara County, where Superior Court Judge Aaron Persky had angered Californians (and internet observers across the country) with the light sentence he handed to student and convicted rapist Brock Turner. And as of now, it looks like Pensky is out—making him the first California judge to be recalled since 1986*. "With 43 percent of precincts reporting, 59 percent of the county's voters favored recalling Persky while 41 percent opposed the recall," reports the San Francisco Chronicle.

California races commanded a disproportionate amount of media coverage, in part due to Democrats' fears that the state's top-two-take-all primary system could shut the party's candidates out of some key races entirely. But in the end, "Democrats appear to have secured at least a second-place finish in every race they targeted," according to The Hill:

With plenty of votes left to count, Democrats felt confident about their chances of claiming a spot in the November runoff in districts held by Reps. Ed Royce (R) and Darrell Issa (R), who are retiring, and Reps. Mimi Walters (R) and Dana Rohrabacher (R), who are seeking another term.

Other notable California results:

One of the biggest themes to emerge yesterday—and in the 2018 primaries so far—was the triumph of liberal women candidates over their Democratic male counterparts (with some of this dynamic on the GOP side, too). "So far this cycle, women have won 47 of 68 incumbent-less Democratic primary matchups with male candidates" for the U.S. Senate, the U.S. House, and gubernatorial seats, according to Nathaniel Rakich of Inside Elections and FiveThirtyEight.

In gubernatorial races:

In congressional races:

It also looks like Iowa GOP Rep. Greg Gianforte, best known for body-slamming a journalist, will face a female challenger, former state lawmaker Kathleen Williams.

A few more highlights and lowlights from the June 6 primaries:

Alabama: "If there was any doubt that the Republican Party was now the party of Donald Trump, Tuesday's results in a deep-red Alabama congressional race should put it to rest," writes Deirdre Shesgreen in USA Today. "Incumbent Republican Rep. Martha Roby came under fierce fire in her GOP primary for withdrawing her endorsement of Trump in the 2016 presidential race," and "those attacks took their toll," with Roby "forced into a runoff on Tuesday after failing to win the GOP nod outright" against Bobby Bright, whose campaign ads accused her of turning "her back on President Trump when he needed her the most."

Also, this:

Etowah County Sheriff Todd Entrekin, who was found to have "personally pocketed more than $750,000 worth of funds allocated to feed inmates in the county jail he oversees," lost his re-election bid in the GOP primary tonight in Alabama. https://t.co/otN6O26heY

Missouri

Montana: State Auditor Matthew Rosendale got the GOP nod to run for a U.S. Senate seat against Democratic incumbent Sen. Jon Tester.

New Jersey: In a state where "Democratic leaders are hoping to flip as many as four of the five Republican-held districts," last night gave them promising results, according to The New York Times. Former Navy pilot Mikie Sherrill got the nod to run for a House of Representatives seat opened by Rep. Rodney Frelinghuysen's retirement (she'll face GOP state Rep. Jay Webber in the general election). And U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez thwarted same-party challengers for his seat.

In November, Sen. Menendez will square off against former Celgene Corp. CEO Bob Hugin, who promises to be an "independent voice" in Washington if elected. Hugin, a Republican, describes himself as "pro-choice, pro-marriage equality, and [a strong supporter of] equal pay for equal work" who believes we "need to fix our immigration system in a comprehensive and compassionate way."

FREE MARKETS

Medicare going broke sooner than expected.

BREAKING: Government: Medicare will become insolvent in 2026, three years earlier than expected, Social Security to follow in 2034.

According to a new report from the Medicare and Social Security trustees, Medicare's expected insolvency date is actually 2026, not 2029 as previously estimated. The projected Social Security insolvency date is still 2034.

QUICK HITS

CORRECTION: This post previously stated that Pensky was the first California judge to be recalled since 1932. However, California Chief Justice Rose Bird was voted out of office in 1986.

http://apnews.com/27e8179cf101.....ap-dollars

The report by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations revealed that under President Barack Obama, the Treasury Department issued a license in February 2016, never previously disclosed, that would have allowed Iran to convert $5.7 billion it held at a bank in Oman from Omani rials into euros by exchanging them first into U.S. dollars. If the Omani bank had allowed the exchange without such a license, it would have violated sanctions that bar Iran from transactions that touch the U.S. financial system.

The effort was unsuccessful because American banks — themselves afraid of running afoul of U.S. sanctions — declined to participate. The Obama administration approached two U.S. banks to facilitate the conversion, the report said, but both refused, citing the reputational risk of doing business with or for Iran.

"The Obama administration misled the American people and Congress because they were desperate to get a deal with Iran," said Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, the subcommittee's chairman.

"...As for why the transfer was made in cash, given that the previous claims reached through The Hague tribunal were paid via wire, U.S. officials have cited the impact of increasingly tough sanctions imposed on Iran. If time was of the essence, cash was the best way to go."

The US owed Iran that money, you moronic Canuck.

"The VTVPA does not say that the USG could never release the FMS funds to Iran; it says the funds could not be released to Iran 'until such subrogated claims have been dealt with to the satisfaction of the United States,'" he said. "I assume that when the Obama administration paid the FMS funds plus interest to Iran, they concluded that this VTVPA provision was satisfied."

The Treasury inspector general (IG) examined the payments and reported on Nov. 10, 2016 that it had received verbal assurance from the Justice Department "that the settlement comports with the VTVPA." In its semiannual report to Congress in March 2017, the IG said the payment was made "after receiving necessary information and authorizations from the Departments of Justice and State."

That money was stolen from the old regime. It didn't owe them that. Stop lying. And even if it was owed, it could have been given to them electronically rather than in untraceable cash. Even if you buy your bullshit, Obama was apparently too stupid to understand why they wanted it in cash or more likely didn't care and was happy to help them more easily fund their terror operations.

I'm still kind of ambivalent about the top-two primary thing. On the one hand, it's bad not to have more diversity of political views on the general election ballot. But, in areas where one party dominates heavily the real election often ends up being the party primary, and I don't think that's a good thing either. I think maybe it would be better if top 3 got on the ballot.
Perhaps this system would work better if parties were not so dominant in politics. But I don't know if that is something you can avoid. From a politically naive point of view, it seems like a good idea, but practically, maybe it's not so good.

The immunity doesn't give you the ability to lie. It means whatever you say can't be used against you in court. If you lie, the immunity deal doesn't prevent you from being prosecuted for perjury. An immunity deal means they can't use your admissions of wrong doing to prosecute you.

Call the Trump paradox "crass lawfulness." What drives Trump's critics nearly crazy is not any evidence that Trump has broken federal laws per se. Instead, their rub is that there are somehow no criminal statutes against a president boorishly acting "unpresidential" in his loud quest to supercharge the economy, while undoing the entire agenda of his predecessor, who was so dearly beloved by the media, universities, Hollywood, and identity-politics groups.

Style and words are all that matter to the media and political class. Results are immaterial.

I think the Eagles are more in the wrong here.

Everyone always talks about how there needs to be a 'conversation' and 'civil discourse' and when an opportunity comes up to do so, they balk.

As an Eagles fan since 1980, disappointed.

Remember when Tim Thomas didn't want to go on the grounds he disagreed with Obama's policies? Remember how the left and average person reacted? Now they shift and think it's all 'troot to power'.

They had a chance to go to the White House and make their case. The fact that they refused means they are not interested in a conversation. They just want everyone to shut up and give them their way, whatever that is.

Make their case for what? I thought they hadn't been doing any on field protesting. Wasn't it just a chance to go to the white house to celebrate their victory? Which kind of makes not going even dumber. It's not a political event. It's just another chance for famous people to hang out with each other. Which isn't something the president should be doing at the official residence anyway.

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Obama administration secretly sought to give Iran access — albeit briefly — to the U.S. financial system by sidestepping sanctions kept in place after the 2015 nuclear deal, despite repeatedly telling Congress and the public it had no plans to do so.

In the Orange County race to challenge Rep. Dana Rohrabacher for his seat, they've got too many candidates running, and with too much money, so the likely result will be a split of leftists' votes, leaving Democrats with the prospect of two Republicans on the ballot for the November midterms. That's panic time, all right, at least for them.

Democrats are famous for muscling their own candidates into a single party line. But who would have guessed they have actually sought to pare down that crowded plate by telling one of their candidates he's too brown to win?

Seriously, that happened. It's what Democrats reportedly told one of their own candidates, a moderate Reaganite Democrat named Omar Siddiqui, to get him out of there.

The CA Democratic Party gets in touch with the Parties racist roots.

I think the presidency of Bill Clinton is the ultimate indictment of feminism. The most prominent feminists in the country were his strongest backers and the most vicious critics of the women who accused him, of among other things, sexual harassment and rape.

There is no such thing as feminism. There is just a large lobby of pro-abortion activists who call themselves "feminists", but they could care less about women who don't share their extremism on abortion. That's just the truth and I think it goes a long way to explaining why a large chunk of the country (women and men, alike) just roll their eyes when someone mentions "feminism".

CNN "lead" feminist Peggy Drexler on Samantha Bee.

Samantha Bee's message was right even if her word wasn't

But Bee is not Barr — she is not spewing random and racist, anti-Semitic, conspiracy-theory views over years on Twitter, as Barr has, and often in the service of supporting the President's policies. Nor, let's be honest, are we living in a time of particularly polite discourse.

It's important, too, to remember that Bee is a comedian known for delivering a standup monologue which, like that of other comedians, often uses outrageous, boundary-pushing and, to some, offensive comedy to make strong points about politics. In Bee's case, though, and unlike in Barr's, these points are usually made on behalf of those harmed by this President's policies.

Looking at Barr's history, people act like her politics change willy-nilly over the years because she used to be a Democrat, then a Marxist, then a Trumper. I think what people don't want to see, is that she's actually been pretty consistent.

Her whole view is that poor people get a bad go at things. Particularly the working class. Her whole career is based around this kind of thing. Her jumping parties is just her pushing this idea, with the different politics of the time saying who she aligns with. I doubt she's perfectly consistent or anything, but that seems to be more her trajectory from what I've seen.

That's a totally unfair characterization of feminism. Yes, feminists support legal abortion access in all three trimesters, just like all serious libertarians do. But feminism is about more than that.

You should try watching some Feminist Frequency videos on Youtube. You'll learn that the War on Women is not just about trying to defund Planned Parenthood. It's also about video games incorporating the "damsel in distress" trope, the "women as reward" trope, and drawing female characters who are unrealistically attractive.

Marquette University professor says she keeps a diary of "everyday microaggressions" to help her overcome her own "whiteness" in order to "recognize racism."

"Some years ago I began recording everyday microaggressions toward learning to recognize racism, which is so often coded and which whiteness has taught me not to see," Professor Beth Godbee, an assistant professor of English at Marquette University, writes in a May 3 post on her personal blog, "Heart-Head-Hands."

She sounds like a barrel of laughs, doesn't she? I really think the best way to deal with SJWs is just to tell them to fuck off and step back and let people see them for who they are. They are always broken, sad people living miserable lives. There is nothing glamorous or interesting about them. It is just mundane misery and nastiness. Who would want to be like this?

Godbee concludes with an appeal to others, writing, "May we—especially those of [us] who are white, who hold power and privilege within this 'white supremacist world'—do more to name and speak out against injustice. May we do more to find humanity in the midst of dehumanization. May we do more to recognize and counter ongoing, everyday microaggressions."

Nicaragua is a mess.

"A surge of violence has snuffed out economic activity and dimmed prospects to peacefully resolve a political crisis here that began as a protest against tax increases and turned into a revolt against Nicaragua's longtime leader Daniel Ortega."

http://www.wsj.com/articles/ni.....1528235963

It isn't that the Ortega regime has implemented Sandinista socialism--even the former Sandinistas in the military seem to oppose him.

It's not that the Ortega regime has implemented a Chavez program either--although they use that rhetoric, the nationalization of industry in Nicaragua by the Ortega regime has meant that the Ortegas own the means of production privately.

Students, the middle class, women, farmers, the military, they all oppose him--except for the last bunch, the Ortega regime is more like the kleptocracy in Libya under Qaddafi as much as anything. I don't think anybody expected Ortega to be a total sellout to his ideology (everybody seems to think the country is being run by his overbearing, new age, weirdo of a wife).

There used to be intellectual arguments about the Sandanistas and their ideology, but in the end, it was all about stealing the nation blind. There's a lesson in there.

Rigid ideologues like Chavez deserve a rational response, but true believers are rare. Just accuse them of wanting to stuff their pockets with your hard earned money and history says you're probably right.

Chavez stuffed his pockets, too. "Bolivarian" socialist ideology was maybe third on his list of priorities - amassing those sweet, sweet American dollars and doing coca-fueled marathon folk music performances on state tv were far more important to him.
