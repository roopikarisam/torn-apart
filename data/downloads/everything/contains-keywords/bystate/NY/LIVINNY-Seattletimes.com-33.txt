RICHMOND, Calif. (AP) — The Contra Costa County sheriff says an investigation has found no evidence that federal immigration detainees were mistreated at a Richmond jail.

Sheriff David Livingston said Friday that after interviewing more than 100 witnesses and watching hundreds of hours of video, investigators found that nearly all complaints of poor treatment at the West County jail were unfounded.

The Sheriff’s Office houses immigration detainees at the jail under a $6 million federal contract. Thirty-eight women had complained to the San Francisco Chronicle of poor conditions. Some said they were forced to use plastic bags as toilets and one said she was locked up for 23 hours a day.

Livingston said those claims were false. He said detainees have cell keys and can leave for restroom breaks at any time.
