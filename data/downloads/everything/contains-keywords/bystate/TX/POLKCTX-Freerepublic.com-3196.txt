HOUSTON  Central American men separated from their children and held in a detention facility outside Houston are being told they can reunite with their kids at the airport if they agree to sign a voluntary deportation order now, according to one migrant at the facility and two immigration attorneys who have spoken to detainees there. 


A Honduran man who spoke to The Texas Tribune Saturday estimated that 20 to 25 men who have been separated from their children are being housed at the IAH Polk County Secure Adult Detention Center, a privately-operated U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement facility for men located 75 miles outside Houston. He said the majority of those detainees had received the same offer of reunification in exchange for voluntary deportation. 


The 24-year-old detainee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity and requested the Tribune use the pseudonym Carlos because he feared retaliation, told the Tribune that he abandoned his asylum case and agreed to sign voluntary deportation paperwork Friday out of desperation to see his 6-year-old daughter, who was separated from him after the pair illegally crossed the border in late May. The man said two federal officials suggested hed be reunited with his daughter at the airport if he agreed to sign the order, which could lead to him being repatriated to his violence-torn home country in less than two weeks.

 Winning!


Drudge: PAPER: Illegals told they’ll be reunited with children if they sign deportation order...

Full headline: Kids in exchange for deportation: Detained migrants say they were told they could get kids back on way out of U.S.

And?

I dont see a problem with this policy.

I fail to see any problem with this. I thought that was how it is supposed to work.

Good.

And these aren’t immigrants.

These are invaders.

 Not our problem. Maybe this amigo should go home and fix his own country.   


Sounds fair to me.

The solution appears to be a reversal of the action which caused the problem in the first place.

Theyre being offered more than a petty thief ever is.

They should be thankful.

Take her and leave.

I believe they have been told that they have been told this by our other side.

If someone illegally enters with their kids or not, giving them choice to voluntarily deport is good. Otherwise, charge them with a crime, convict, and jail them. Either way they get deported—the easy way or the hard way. For the kids, send them home with or without their parents. They are not our citizens, not our problem. Their home countries can best take care of them. Always.

Enough of these sob stories making the central america rounds should help the aspiring illegal immigrant decide to save their $6000.

Standard way it’s been done for decades.

You wanna stay? Gotta tuff it out in the criminal justice system. Kids don’t get to hang with you in jail.

Wanna leave, get back with La Familia? Fine. Sign the deportation waiver. Charges dropped, you go home.

Nothing new here. SOP.

Or you can have whats behind door number three ...

Yep, it’s the law.

Go home. Take your meal ticket with you.

The solution appears to be a reversal of the action which caused the problem in the first place.

Theyre being offered more than a petty thief ever is.

They should be thankful.

If ya don’t want to be separated from your kids, don’t do the crime.

Can someone help me out here?

When refugees and immigrants came through Ellis Island, weren’t people turned away if they were sick, criminals, or had no sponsors here in the USA?

When did this change?

(I remember my paternal grandmother telling me to stop biting my nails, because that would have gotten me turned away at Ellis Island. I think she was trying to scare me out of the habit.)

Quick fix. Better than jailing them. I think that is humanitarian. Send them and their kids back. The airline fare is cheaper than housing them, feeding them, giving them schooling, free medication, food stamps for generations.
