Public Service/Watchdog


Division I


Journal Sentinel at Milwaukee (First Place-Tie)


Raquel Rutledge, reporter


For the Journal Sentinel's investigation into blackouts at Mexican resorts


Judges said: This is dogged, persistent reporting at its finest. Starting with a single incident involving a Wisconsin family, the Journal-Sentinel, led by reporter Raquel Rutledge , uncovered a pattern of blackouts and deaths related to tainted alcohol; indifferent Mexican authorities; even deletions by Trip Advisor of posts that might have warned others. The reporting leveraged the scope of USA TODAY and the network to find more than 100 such cases. This is a vitally important investigation, built one story at a time.

USA TODAY and Naples Daily News  (First Place-Tie)


Brett Murphy, reporter


For USA TODAY's investigation into the exploitive truck leases used by short-haul trucking companies at California ports


Judges said: "Rigged" details how short-haul truckers at California ports are driven into debt by exploitive vehicle leases. But the series avoids a simplistic good-versus-bad tone. Instead, it sets the problem in the context of regulations requiring newer trucks; the influence of Big Box retailers and Amazon; and all of our desires for ever-cheaper goods. This is nuanced reporting showing the human consequences of a complex global economy.

Asbury Park Press (Third Place)


Shannon Mullen, staff writer


For the Asbury Park Press' investigation of the forces behind squalid rentals in New Jersey.


Judges said: This series starts with a story we think we know - poor renters living in squalor - but digs further to show the unintended consequences of rent subsidies; how some landlords use holes in New Jersey laws and shell companies to evade enforcement; and potential solutions that are working elsewhere.

Division II


Reno Gazette-Journal (First Place)


Anjeanette Damon, government watchdog reporter; Brian Duggan, watchdog content coach


For Death Behind Bars, an investigation, including a battle for public information, that revealed shocking failures by officials that contributed to a spike in the number of deaths of inmates at the Washoe County Jail.


Judges said: The investigation showed -- with data and compelling narratives -- the increase in deaths of inmates and revealed how they could and should have been prevented. It documented how officials had backed away from established standards of care, side-stepped their own policies and failed to even investigate the deaths when they occurred. Beyond that, they concealed all of this from the public. But the Gazette-Journal's aggressive coverage led to policy changes, greater oversight of the operation -- and more public transparency.

Naples Daily News (Second Place)


Maria Perez, reporter


For Florida's Disposable Workers, an examination of how undocumented workers injured in the construction and agriculture industries are abandoned by their employers and the workers' compensation system.


Judges said: This revelatory investigation showed how lawmakers and the industry created a system that ignored the workers' lack of documentation in the hiring process -- and then preyed on their status when they were injured. The crisply-written project documented the disturbing effects of their practices: Workers lost their jobs, were forced to pay for their own medical treatment and were threatened with deportation.

Argus Leader at Sioux Falls (Third Place)


Joe Sneve and Jonathan Ellis, reporters


For the relentless pursuit of public documents involving behind-the-scenes negotiations following construction failures at a publicly financed events center.


Judges said: When the city refused to release documents detailing financial negotiations involving construction problems at the center, the Argus Leader fought back -- all the way to the South Dakota Supreme Court. And when it won the right to the documents, they showed a story much different from the one told by government officials. The beat reporting and court challenge not only held public officials accountable, it has spurred legislative action as well.

Division III


Las Cruces Sun-News (First Place)


Carlos Andres Lopez and Diana Alba Soular, reporters


For the Las Cruces Sun-News' compelling examination of how New Mexico's inadequate mental health system has failed its residents and burdened its communities. 


Judges said: Carlos Andres Lopez and Diana Alba Soular distilled a complex issue into a series of insightful articles that make it impossible for the reader to ignore. From the heartbreaking death of Juan Gabriel Torres to the hard data about New Mexico's suicide rate, the reporters exposed the state's broken mental heath system from multiple angles and in many voices. Their reporting shows the unfortunate consequences of an ill-conceived funding freeze and the pressing need to bring more and better services to the region. The fact they collaborated with other media outlets to report this story is a bonus.

Visalia Times-Delta (Second Place)


James Houck. reporter


For the Visalia Times-Delta's coverage of the systemic problems that caused at least two patient deaths at the Tulare Regional Medical Center and threatened to strip the hospital of its Medicare funding.


Judges said: Had James Houck not unearthed and methodically laid out details from a state report on Tulare Regional Medical Center, the public never would have known about the deadly risks this hospital took with patients' lives -- scheduling surgeries at odd hours and without backup staff; poor hospital management; conflicts among staff. The hospital since has fixed many of its problems for the benefit of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which threatened to strip its funding. But Houck's reporting holds them accountable to the people who really matter: the public.  It's journalism at its finest.

The Daily Times at Salisbury (Third Place)


Jeremy Cox and Liz Holland, staff writers


For The Daily Times at Salisbury's deep dive into the community's rental housing problems, which have left a disproportionate number of residents burdened by high costs while the city appears to twiddle its thumbs. 


Judges said: Jeremy Cox and Liz Holland lifted the veil on Salisbury's rental crisis, showing exactly how and why so many of the city's residents struggle to find affordable rental housing and how it impacts the community. Excellent use of data and real-life examples show both the complexity and importance of this issue in a place where the majority of residents are renters. This investigation should be a wake-up call to community leaders who need to get serious about affordable housing if they want Salisbury to succeed.

For the Staunton News Leader's account of a young mother's murder


Judges said: Detailed, disturbing, and riveting, this entry describes the murder of a young mother by a powerful, enraged, knife-wielding assailant as she tries to prevent him from killing her friend. The article avoids idealizing the victim, who, like the others, had been using drugs before the murder. By casting her in three dimensions, the News Leader makes the tragedy seem all the more real to the reader.

San Angelo Standard-Times (Third Place)


Ngan Ho, reporter


For Ngan Ho's terrific visual and audio technique on a piece about a craftsman with endless pride for his region. 


Judges said: The diversity of shots, from detailed views of hand-made spurs to establishing glimpses of the film crew, brought a small shop in Texas to life on our screens. A world many only know from old films turns modern as the video unfolds.

Consumer Engagement and Experiences


Division I


Detroit Free Press (First Place)


Ashley Woods, consumer experience director; Brian Todd, web editor; Rochelle Riley, columnist


For the Detroit Free Press' inventive use of social media, video and audio for an engaging way to bring people into the story of the 1967 riots. 


Judges said: By re-creating the 1967 riots live, in real time on social media, the Free Press was able to effectively engage today's audiences -- including younger people who might never visit the Free Press site and who likely didn't have a meaningful understanding of this crucial part of Detroit's history.  Their translation of past events into a current timeline was brilliant and tastefully executed and certainly helped to grow the Freep's long term audience.

The Des Moines Register (Second Place)


Staff


For the Des Moines Register's successful effort to make mental health an important issue in the Iowa gubernatorial race. 


Judges said: This began as one person's obituary and quickly snowballed, as a political columnist's work drew in sponsors and partners and brought 12 candidates and 400 people together for a meaningful conversation.  The coverage of the event by other news organizations and the fact that mental health is now a key issue in the race are proof of the significant impact of the Register's efforts.

Judges said: This useful service builds goodwill with the very people who should be reading every day: People who are building their jobs and their futures in the community.  While helping people become better prepared to get jobs, the Press was able to sign them up for newsletters and other ongoing engagement channels as well.

For The Coloradoan's effort to create direct, ongoing conversations between journalists and the community they serve. 


Judges said: By convening conversations among community members, journalists and decision makers, the Coloradoan is breaking down some of the distrust and skepticism that unfortunately surrounds our work these days.  And in Colorado, we can't imagine a better way to make that connection than over craft beers and fancy coffee.

Laura Peters, reporter


For Laura Peters' commitment, and willingness, to engage with the community over a difficult issue with which she herself has struggled. 


Judges said: Reporters are supposed to be more engaged today, putting themselves out there in social media and elsewhere.  Laura Peters takes her role as a journalist to the next level in this case, immersing in a story that's deeply emotional for her and vital to her community.  Her willingness to shine a light on this difficult subject in such a respectful and personal way -- with fundraising and public speaking on top of her reporting and writing -- exemplifies the type of meaningful connection that builds long-term community relationships.

Daniel Carson, reporter; Molly Corfman, photojournalist


For reporter Daniel Carson and photojournalist Molly Corfman's efforts  to bring their important documentary work directly to their audience. 


Judges said: After a year of interviews and research, the reporter and photographer took the initiative to create a community premiere event and publicize it themselves. The response, including requests for the film to be shown at other venues and to include it in training programs, suggests that the deep insights into these victims will have positive impact and lead to meaningful long-term community partnerships.

Digital Storytelling


Division I


Journal Sentinel at Milwaukee (First Place)


Staff


For Unsolved, the Journal Sentinel's multimedia story and podcast about the mysterious death of a toddler in 1981. 


Judges said: This package is distinctly digital, built with the right mix of tools and formats to tell a compelling story in a powerful way.  Extensive use of police reports, court filings and other source materials pulled back the curtain on the ways journalists report such a complex story, bolstering credibility at a time when that's essential. Graphics answered questions readers would have, and the ever-present "Reader Guide" is the perfect companion.

Design — Best Breaking News Design


Louisville Design Studio (First Place)


Kyle Slagle, team leader


For the design of the Courier Journal's "Eclipse" coverage. 


Judges said: It was a bold decision and superb editing to create a wraparound photo poster front page for this news event. The photo told the story without words. The photo was stunning. The execution was perfect, even the placement of the bar code. It was shot by a staff member, perhaps with a plan for a wrap. Or there may have been a great response to the photo and the wrap became a scramble on deadline. In any case, the judges agreed it was the news of the day and told the story of that day -- beautifully! Only print media can play pictures this big for readers to hold and contemplate. 


Asbury Park Design Studio (Second Place)


Dana Stewart, designer; Eric Pinckney, designer; Erin McGowan, designer; Kim Harris (now with the Phoenix Design Studio), team leader



 


For the design of Rochester's coverage of the windstorm of the decade.



Judges said: Compelling photography, especially the cover art. It looks like a breaking news section because of color and photo choices, but has all of the deliberation of a section that took much longer to create.



 


Louisville Design Studio (Third Place)


Kyle Slagle, team leader



 


For the design of the Courier Journal's "Pitino Fired" coverage.


Judges said: A powerful page, with the art and words working well together. The presentation is bold but straightforward, not trying to lead the reader to any conclusions about an unfolding story.



Design — Best Cover


Nashville Design Studio (First Place)


Merry Eccles, designer 


For the design of Memphis' "Shades of Elvis" cover.


Judges said: 'Shades of Elvis' is the clear winner for us. The technical mastery of Merry Eccles' photo collage illustration is remarkable. The overall portrait is well executed, and the choice of photos gives the reader plenty of  visual detail to enjoy. The black and white photos, combined with the confident use of white space works well with the touch of color in the headline. The overall effect is sophisticated and beautiful. Kudos as well for the clever headline.



Louisville Design Studio (Second Place)


Branden Barker, designer



 


For the design of the Lansing's "Michigan on Tap."


Judges said: This is a great concept wonderfully executed. It has huge impact yet was beautifully simple and clean.

Design — Best alternative story form


Phoenix Design Studio (First Place)


Aliya Mood, team leader



 


For the design of The Arizona Republic's Border Wall doubletruck infographic.


Judges said: The doubletruck has so much good information in it, and immediately shows the scope of this endeavor. The presentation is a very powerful way to tell a story that is not as predictable as a lot of gun icons or people icons (a typical approach we saw numerous times throughout the year, and across the industry).


The graphic packs a depth of information into a really clean and simple format that is approachable and understandable on an issue of immense local and national importance.



 


Nashville Design Studio (Second Place)


Merry Eccles, designer (now with the Phoenix Design Studio)



 


For design of Nashville's "Flight of Fancy."

Aviva Loeb and Mallory Price, designers


For design of The Arizona Republic's Page 1A breakdown of the murders in 2016.



Judges said: Good, clean use of color, and the color is informative.  Smart placement of the story within the graphic. Good use of icons. The graphic is easy to read considering how much information it carries.



 


Design — Enterprise


Nashville Design Studio (First Place)


Bill Campling, designer; Kent Travis, graphics (both now with the Des Moines Design Studio)


For design of the Tennessee Network's look at Tennessee's struggle with opioid addiction.


Judges said: We appreciated the overall boldness of the Opiates project packaging. We appreciated the conceptual thinking, the stunning logo, the wee characters interacting with headlines on each page, as well as the consistency and pacing of the pages. This is an ambitious piece of reporting that demonstrates the power that can be leveraged from combining the carefully crafted writing of in-depth research and storytelling, thoughtful photos, charts, lists and quotes. The content is important and timely.


Phoenix Design Studio (Second Place)


Také Uda, team leader



For design of The Desert Sun's "California's Dying Sea" project.

Design — Best Special Section


Nashville Design Studio (First Place)


Jamie Stade, designer


For the design of the Clarion Ledger's "Mississippi Eats" section.


Judges said: There was so much beauty in all the entries in this category, but the attention to detail and page-after-page excellence lifted the Mississippi Eats section above the rest. The designer created a fabulous design palette (get it?) and then massaged it ever so gently throughout the section, adding delicate and intricate touches. The brilliant use of typography and white space combined to create a delicious feast for the readers.



Phoenix Design Studio (Second Place)


Micaela Encinas, designer


For the design of the Arizona Republic's "Scenic Arizona" section


Judges said: Great editing and display of photos, with lovely spacing to let those photos shine. The typography and design is appropriately low key and augments the section through its restraint, rather than intruding on it.


Phoenix Design Studio (Third Place)


Tricia Reinhold, creative director


For the design of St. George's premium edition "The Best of Lyman."


Judges said: The retro magazine feel so deftly executed throughout is a wonderful touch with this story. It's a lovely surprise for readers.
