MCALLEN, Texas—The two Honduran mothers didn’t run when the Border Patrol agents found them along a muddy border road Monday, near where Mexico ends and the U.S. begins.

The suspected smuggler who guided the women, their children and two teenage boys, had fled back toward the Rio Grande when they encountered the agents—and escaped. But the group of migrants stayed put and were quickly loaded into a van and taken to a nearby federal immigration-processing center.
