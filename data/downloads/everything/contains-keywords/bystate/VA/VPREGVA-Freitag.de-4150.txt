Houthi-Saleh militias on Friday broke into the house of a teacher in Taiz, executing three of his relatives including a woman by firing squad. 

Local sources told Alsahw Net that the militias broke into the house located in Saber al-Mawadem in the east of Taiz, shooting the three persons dead, pointing out that the killed persons are Etehad Qasem, Anas Fara'a and Mohammed Fara'a .

Yemen’s Houthis planning mass arrests of Saleh loyalists

The Houthi armed group has prepared a long list of President Ali Abdullah Saleh loyalists to arrest, Sky News Arabia reported.

The names include military, security and political leaders loyal to Saleh who are to be arrested on various charges. It is unclear what the charges are, and why this has occurred at this time.

The Houthi armed group has a track record of arresting individuals for dissenting against their governance in Yemen. Prominent activist and journalist Hisham Al-Omeisy was arrested by the Houthis in August. Al-Omeisy’s location remains unknown and his family has still not heard from him.

A Yemeni Political Analyst Has Been Held By Houthi Rebels Since August, With No Explanation

Prominent Yemeni political analyst and writer Hisham Al-Omeisy has been held incommunicado since being detained in August.

According to Amnesty International, members of the Houthi-controlled National Security Bureau arrested Al-Omeisy in the capital Sana'a on 14 August 2017. Al-Omeisy's is a crucial voice in reporting the ongoing conflict in Yemen. He has been critical of both warring parties.

With more than 32 thousand Twitter followers, Al-Omeisy has been actively tweeting about the humanitarian crisis and violations committed by both warring parties. Prior to his arrest, he had analyzed and spoken about the conflict to international media including the BBC, CNN, Al Jazeera, Deutsche Welle, NPR and TRT World. Al-Omeisy is also a contributor to The Observers, a collaborative site by France 24 that covers international affairs by verifying and contextualizing eyewitness accounts shared by contributors. Earlier this year, he penned a story on the humanitarian impact of the war, describing how he has attempted to shield his children, two boys aged seven and 11, from the “ugly realities” of the conflict by censoring himself in their conversations.

It remains unclear why Al-Omeisy was arrested. But prior to his arrest, on 12 August, he tweeted in both Arabic and English about “corrupt officials” confiscating real estate by force in the capital Sana'a.

It remains unclear who these “armed goons” are, and whether this tweet has anything to do with his arbitrary detention, but since Sana'a is under the control of Houthi militias and Saleh forces, one can imagine that he may have been referring to these groups.

Iona Craig, a journalist covering Yemen and a friend of Al-Omeisy, told CBC Radio that “it could be those two events are connected.” She also added that Hisham was previously interrogated by the Houthi-Saleh forces for his outspokenness. 

As Al-Omeisy remains in arbitrary detention and without charge, his friends and supporters continue to demand his release (with images)

Drone shot down by Houthis suggests US support for Saudi coalition air strikes

One Yemeni citizen was very clear that the people can hear the sounds of drones every night in Sana’a, but were surprised to know that this was a US drone. “What,” asked Hussam Al-Sanabani, “was it doing?”

He was referring to the US drone shot down by the Iranian-backed Houthi group in the Yemeni capital last weekend. The presence of US drones over Houthi-controlled territory suggests that Washington is providing intelligence support to the Saudi-led coalition. War crime allegations have been levied against Saudi Arabia for targeting civilians indiscriminately in air strikes.

What role are the US drones playing in all of this, especially in providing intelligence for the coalition air strikes which have killed hundreds of civilians? 

The absence of AQAP in Houthi-controlled areas is well-known, said Yemen-based journalist Hussain Albukhaiti. “The number of US drones over Sana’a has increased since the war started, which means that their job is to collect information and pictures as well as to coordinate for the Saudi led coalition,” he claimed.

Yemen's unpaid teachers strike as education crisis deepens

"I had to quit my job as a teacher to find a way to provide for my family," says Yousef, a former primary school teacher from Sanaa now working as a builder.

At least 166,443 teachers - approximately 73% of the national total - have also not received their salaries since October 2016, according to the Unicef mission in Yemen.

They are among 1.5 million civil servants only paid sporadically over the past year.

The Houthis announced that the academic year would start on 30 September, but a call by the teachers' union for a strike over pay has been widely heeded, with only a fraction turning up for work.

According to figures made available to the BBC by the Unicef mission, 12,240 of the 15,826 functioning schools in Yemen are affected by the strikes.

U.N. blacklists Saudi-led coalition for killing children in Yemen

The United Nations blacklisted a Saudi Arabia-led military coalition on Thursday for killing and injuring 683 children in Yemen and attacking dozens of schools and hospitals in 2016, even as it said the coalition had taken action to improve child protection.

The blacklist attached to the U.N. annual report on children in armed conflict also named the Iran-allied Houthi rebel group, Yemen government forces, pro-government militia and Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula for violations against children in 2016.

In an effort to dampen controversy surrounding the report, the blacklist this year is split into two categories. One lists parties that have put in place measures to protect children, which includes the Saudi-led military coalition, and the other includes parties that have not.

War in Yemen: UN blacklists Saudi-led coalition for killing children

The UN has added the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen to its annual list of shame for killing hundreds of children in 2016. But the world body noted that the coalition had put in place some measures to protect kids.

In a bid to dampen controversy, for the first time, the new list in the annual report on children in armed conflict has been split into two parts by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. Both list parties that recruit, use, kill, maim, rape, sexually, abuse or abduct children in armed conflict or attack schools and hospitals.

However, one of the lists catalogs parties "that have put in place measures during the reporting period to improve the protection of children," which includes the Saudi-led coalition and the other includes parties that have not taken any action to ensure children are not violated.

Guterres said the blacklist was "not only to raise awareness" but also to "promote measures that can diminish the tragic plight of children in conflict."

How the Saudis are making it almost impossible to report on their war in Yemen

The conflict is not getting anything like the media attention it deserves.

The scant media coverage is not without reason, or wholly because the general public is too cold-hearted to care. It is very hard to get into Yemen. The risks for the few foreign journalists who gain access are significant. And the Saudi-led coalition waging war in the country is doing its best to make it difficult, if not impossible, to report from the area.

The new arrangement significantly increased the cost and time involved – two things that most media organisations are short of.

He said that blocking media access was part of the Saudi-led coalition’s strategy to “bring [Yemen] to its knees in an atmosphere of silence and indifference.”

Access is not the only problem. Reporting in Yemen carries great risks. The British Foreign Office warns of a “very high threat of kidnap and unlawful detention from militia groups, armed tribes, criminals and terrorists”. It specifically mentions journalists as a group that could be targeted – by Ahmed Baider and Lizzie Porter

Al Qaeda, ISIS are ‘Biggest Winners’ in Saudi Campaign

The Cipher Brief’s Bennett Seftel spoke with Arrabyee about the daily difficulties facing the Yemeni population as well as how the U.S. can help bring an end to the country’s three-year-old civil war.

Arrabyee: No, there will be no peace deal in the near or distant future without the will of the U.S. administration to reach such a deal. I said this about two years ago, here in The Cipher Brief, and nothing has changed.

Saudi Arabia wants to destroy Iran by destroying Yemen, this is a big mistake. Iran is happy to see the Saudis fight while Iran loses nothing.

If U.S., UK, and French leaders think that a peace deal will come about by supporting their beloved oil-rich, Wahabi Saudi regime in starving Yemenis to death or submission, then they are completely wrong.

Yemen's cholera crisis laid bare in new hospital footage

New footage from inside several hospitals in Yemen reveals the crisis facing the war-torn country as it battles to contain one of the world's worst ever outbreaks of cholera.

The videos, provided to CNN by the International Rescue Committee, show children being treated for possible symptoms of the infectious disease in hospitals and mobile health units in the city of Aden and other areas in southern Yemen in late August.

"The cholera outbreak in Yemen is one of the worst I have ever seen in my 25 years of working in humanitarian aid," said Zvidzai Maburutse, the deputy director of the IRC's Yemen program. "What is left of the health system in Yemen today is at best inadequate and at worst nonexistent." (with film and photos)

Saudis tackle border spillover from Yemen war

The Huthi rebels, well-versed in the region's rugged topography, have mounted numerous cross-border raids in retaliation against Saudi airstrikes on their Yemeni strongholds.

The Iran-backed insurgents’ hit-and-run incursions and rocket barrages have not jeopardised Saudi control of the vast frontier, but they have underscored how the raging conflict in Yemen is spilling across the border, threatening scores of villages like Al Khubah.

Crisis in Yemen deepens 

Under the R2P doctrine, the community of nations has a duty to protect civilians from genocide, ethnic cleansing and/or mass civilian death.

Should the United Nations Security Council apply the Responsibility to Protect (R2P) doctrine in Yemen?

Film: Yemen - A Mine Ends The Dream Of A Girl Getting Married

Dalila al-Sharabi, a Yemeni girl getting married living in Taiz in southern Yemen, was forced to flee to the areas near Taiz, while the mother preferred to stay in their home, refusing to leave. Delilah was longing to see her mother, so she paid her a visit and during her stay at her mother's house, a fight broke out in the area near her family's home for three days. After relative calm, Dalila stepped in front of the house not knowing that this was her last step. A land mine exploded causing her to lose her two legs, turning her delight into a nightmare.

Poverty kills: The Yemenis defusing missiles for money

Yemen is littered with unexploded rockets and mortars - and people ready to risk their lives to extract precious metals

Mohammed al-Namer, in charge of clearing mines in Taiz, said desperate residents were pulling apart unexploded missiles fired by Saudi Arabia to extract sellable metals, including brass and copper.

"Five people were breaking up a missile after an air strike inside a camp in the Taiz' al-Ganad area in August," he said. "The missile exploded and killed all five of them.

"Most howitzer and Katyusha rockets and mortars did not explode when fired," he said. Instead, they lay on the ground, a fatal risk for returning residents.

There are no accurate figures on the quantity of armaments which have been dropped on

Children as well as adults are engaged in the recycling business, he said. "The dire need for money means that desperate people don't inform the authorities about missiles. Instead they sacrifice their lives trying to extract metals from explosive remnants of war. People need to be aware that scrap metals can kill them."

‘While we welcome the overdue listing of the Saudi Arabia-led coalition in the CAAC report, it is a shame that the UN caved in to pressure and included it in a new category specifically designed to limit condemnation of the coalition’ - Sherine Tadros

The international community has caved in to political pressure by watering down criticism of the Saudi Arabia-led coalition’s grave violations of international law in the UN Secretary-General’s annual Children and Armed Conflict report, said Amnesty International.

Verletzte Kinderrechte - Uno geißelt saudi-arabische Koalition

Die Uno beklagt schwere Verstöße gegen Kinderrechte im Jemen. Die Vorwürfe richten sich vor allem gegen das von Saudi-Arabien geführte Militärbündnis, das auch Schulen und Krankenhäuser angegriffen haben soll.

Die Vereinten Nationen (Uno) werfen der von Saudi-Arabien geführten Militärkoalition im Jemen vor, Kinderrechte zu verletzen. Deshalb soll das Bündnis auf die jährliche schwarze Liste der Uno aufgenommen werden.

Die Koalition sei allein im vergangenen Jahr für den Tod von 683 Kindern verantwortlich gewesen, hieß es in einem Entwurf des Berichts, der der Nachrichtenagentur AFP vorlag.

No commission on Yemen

Saudi Arabia has accepted an “examination”, not inquiry, into human rights abuses in the conduct of its military campaign in Yemen, an outcome not enough for some

The last-minute Dutch amendment came after France, not currently a member of the council, pushed for a compromise.

“We are working in particular to narrow positions on the international dimension of the investigation mechanism on the violation of human rights committed in Yemen,” French Foreign Ministry Spokeswoman Agnes Romatet-Espagne told reporters.

The French statement appeared to echo Britain and the United States, which wanted to see consensus around a single resolution.

The Netherlands, after coming under intense pressure to soften its position, expressed confidence that it had preserved its main demand.

Dr. Foad’s speech during the side event on Yemen organized by Khiam Rehabilitation Center on 13 Sep 2017

The lack of an effective role of the Security Council as well as international institutions including the international criminal court in Hague, at a time where no real efforts were exerted to bring this war to a complete end, would, unfortunately, cause more pain to the Yemeni women and children.

It should be said clearly and loudly, the war on Yemen debunked the immorality of the international order and institutions. 

As we speak under the umbrella of Human Rights Council, it is our moral obligation to voice out our objection to Saudi kingdom being a member state in HRC, while it continues vehemently violating human rights principles and UN human rights declaration.

What drove Saudi Arabia to lift driving ban? It's not all about women.

Alleviating the burden on middle-class Saudi families is part of it. So is the boon to the economy from enabling women's employment. But it could also be a distraction as the crown prince consolidates power and cracks down on dissent.

One of the major factors that may have determined the timing of the royal decree is the man behind it.

“Under the crown prince, it has been more centralized than ever; he has accumulated unprecedented power,” says Frederic Wehrey, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. “With centralized power, the crown prince can push through reform, whatever his motives are.”

An Israeli general: Saudi Arabia and its allies control Bab al-Mandab for our benefit

"The most important positive change in the Red Sea region for Israel is that the Saudi-led Sunni Arab Alliance can regain control of the region," said Shaoul Shay, head of the research department at Israel's multi-directional Herzliya Center. The Strait of Bab al-Mandab and the expulsion of the Huthi militias from it.

In an analysis published by Israel Hayom newspaper, Al-Arabi wrote in the New Arab newspaper , "Tea", the waterways in the Red Sea are now under the control of the "moderate Sunni camp," referring to Egypt's control of the Suez Canal, Saudi Arabia and the UAE on the door Al Mandab.

US approves $15bn sale of anti-missile THAAD system to Saudi Arabia

The US State Department has approved the possible sale of a Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) anti-missile defence system to Saudi Arabia at an estimated cost of $15bn, the Pentagon said on Friday.

The proposed sale "will support the foreign policy and national security objectives of the United States by improving the security of a friendly country" and will not alter the basic military balance in the region, the Pentagon's Defense Security Cooperation agency said in a statement.

Lockheed Martin and Raytheon are the principal contractors for THAAD.

Unregulated arms trade ruined 'every aspect of civilian life' in Yemen, says ICRC

The unfettered flow of arms into Yemen has fuelled the ongoing civil war and helped "erode almost every aspect of civilian life," according to the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC). 

Speaking in Geneva, Peter Maurer, head of the ICRC, urged countries around the world to act on the Arms Trade Treaty (ATT), which was adopted by the UN in 2013.

His comments come as countries from around the world meet in Geneva this week to discuss how best to implement the ATT as the civilian death toll continues to rise in Yemen and other civil wars around the world.

There is emerging in the Middle East, not a Shia Crescent, but actually an Iranian Shia encirclement from Iraq in the north to both the Persian Gulf and Red Sea waterways and Yemeni land area to the south, east and west.

The objective? To control the oil and gas resources of the Saudi peninsula, giving Iran enormous effectively blackmail leverage over the industrialized economies of the Western world, access to hundreds of billions in revenue, and consequently help establish Iran as the leading hegemonic power in the region.

Three strategies have been adopted by Iran to achieve this goal.

Yemen: Murky With A Chance of Treachery

Iran has had a number of notable failures in Yemen. Arab air defenses (especially against ballistic missiles) have been particularly effective and that is discouraging to Iran. So has the competence of the Gulf Arab Air Forces in carrying out a sustained aerial campaign using modern aircraft. The coalition had over 200 combat (mostly) and support aircraft, including several dozen helicopters (most of them armed). That proved to be untrue because crew killed when aircraft (20 so far) were lost were named, hailed as heroes and their careers were described in detail. Most of the aircraft lost were Saudi (12) followed by the UAE (5) with Morocco, Jordan, Bahrain losing one each. That was roughly in proportion to how many aircraft each coalition member contributed.

Allein Ägypten wird in fünfzehn Jahren um 28 Millionen Einwohner wachsen, Algerien um 10 Millionen, der Jemen um 9. Schon heute findet nur eine Minderheit von rd. 40% einen Arbeitsplatz.

Im „Pulverfass vor den Toren Europas“, wie die Studienautoren die politisch instabile Mena-Region bezeichnen, wächst die Bevölkerung sehr viel schneller als die Wirtschaft:

Friends of Hadhramaut

The idea of forming “Friends of Hadhramaut” came as a result of a visit to the area by Sultana al-Qu’aiti MBE and Brian Fyfield-Shayler, as part of an expedition organised in 1996 by Jim Ellis OBE, who became our second Patron.

The trust is registered with the Charity Commissioners of England and Wales. Though based in the United Kingdom it has been an international effort from the start, drawing on the goodwill of over 600 well-wishers around the world. Our work is purely humanitarian and strictly non-political.

The trust promotes philanthropic, educational and medical links between the people of Hadhramaut and overseas, bringing their needs to the attention of those who may be in the best position to help. We aim to raise living standards, individually and collectively, relieving poverty wherever we can.
