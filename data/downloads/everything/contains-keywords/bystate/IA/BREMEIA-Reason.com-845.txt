I am a college professor at VCU, in the Political Science Department. I have been visiting the Conspiracy a few months after it was created. I enjoy the site as the various contributors give me perspectives I typically do not receive where I work or at pretty much any other venue.

Chris, living in Virginia although earlier lived in midwest &amp; west coast.

Work in finance and started visiting/lurking shortly before VC moved to the Post, where I felt inclined to comment for the first time.

My wife (among others) has consistently suggested/teased that I should have been a lawyer. The topics on the VC have me wondering if I should pursue a law degree (even if the idea of even more additional schooling after already having a professional certification is unpleasant).

Well, I woke up in a Soho doorway and apparently a policeman knew my name. He said "You can go sleep at home tonight If you can get up and walk away."

I found that acceptable, so I staggered back to the underground, and the breeze blew back my hair. Really, the only thing I remember is throwing punches around and preaching from my chair.

I hope that's helpful.

I enjoy 2nd amendment issues, but really like all the constitutional stuff (1st amendment, 4th amendment and so forth). I have enjoyed the emoluments clause issues as well. I enjoy climate science, and look forward to climate science litigation issues in 2018. Hopefully the Mann vs. Steyn case will wrap up in 2018, and you guys can write about it.

I am a military veteran currently working as an accountant while preparing for the LSAT. Seven or eight years ago, I was blackmailed by John L. Steele of Prenda Law. I had never been threatened with a lawsuit before, so I was doing some online research (trying to decide if I even want to respond to the letter), and thus discovered your blog.
I have been a regular reader ever since. I never miss a Short Circuit, and I read many other articles as well. While I do not completely agree with every author politically, it is especially refreshing to read a well-reasoned perspective when it's one which challenges your beliefs at least somewhat. I hope these years of reading will help a bit in law school. Thank you for all you do!

I was an ink-stained wretch at several mid-metropolitan newspapers before ending up at the largest daily in the West. I made a mid-career change to the only profession that ranks lower than journalist and became a lawyer, practicing in California and Nevada (now retired). My passions are journalism and horse racing, but I squeeze in VC between visits to racing sites. I've been reading for about four years on and off, and daily for the last two years or so. Don't always agree, but I like to read opinions with other viewpoints, and so far VC hasn't touted a sure thing that finds a way to lose. Unless you count the 2016 election.

Jeff Walden|1.4.18 @ 4:12AM|#

Yeah, VC comment threads are great. Hopefully the move away from WaPo will improve them -- they took a little bit of a dive when that move happened. I can't immediately think of a case where a comment thread changed my mind, but they've certainly contributed to mind-changes and taught me stuff. Even if I can't identify an exact change due to comments, I can think of cases where my opinion on something's done a 180.

For example, when Herring v. United States was still at the cert stage at the Supreme Court 2009ish, I read the summary, thought Herring should lost, then was approximately gratified when he lost 5-4, conservative-ish justices against the liberal minority. (Not that I cared strongly about the issue, just happy to see the people in power had thought as I did.) Fast-forward almost nine years now, and somehow I've reached exactly the opposite opinion, think Leon's good-faith exception is a bit bonkers, and have not much idea how it is I could have thought Herring should lose before. Some of that, I'm certain, is due to all the posts and comments I've read here. (And elsewhere, my curiosity kindled by what I've read here.)

Thanks for all the wisdom, everyone. And all the not-quite-wisdom. :-) And for much entertainment and laughs too.

Even though as a Canadian the specifics of the legal issues discussed here don't always directly affect me, the general themes and principles still resonate and I find them useful in prompting me to evaluate my own opinions and my justifications for them.

Went to school for computer science, and took the LSAT and got accepted at a law school. I wanted to be an IP lawyer (even though ConLaw is my first love). Decided against it to due to financial and happiness concerns.

I've been a law enthusiast since high school, especially around liberty and justice. I found your site before the WaPo move, and been following since.

I'm an unemployed, unskilled laborer in Lincoln, Nebraska. I'm an Army vet and college dropout with a tendency to itinerance. (I probably won't be unemployed for too long. I just fell off the end of college football seasonal work.)

I became interested in law while temping for a Washington State administrative court. I found that a clearer understanding of the contours of law helped hone my political philosophy and better understand current events. Yours was the first law blog I followed, since somewhat before the WaPo move, and it has been enormously useful and often entertaining.

In short, I'm an incredibly boring guy whose idea of a good time is to get a pizza from the convenience store,* crack open a beer,** and try to get my fast-food-worker friends into a rousing discussion of adminstrative agency deference doctrines.

* When I came to Nebraska I mocked the very idea of convenience store pizza as a sort of Platonic anti-ideal version of the food. But Casey's General Stores pizza is better-than-mediocre and pretty cheap.

** I'm a beer snob, which I bring up only to note that my boringness is multifaceted, like a cardboard gemstone. I also enjoy trivia games, gardening, and reading in stony silence.

And I don't think we're as far apart politically as all that. (Er, that is, I don't think NToJ and I are as far apart politically as all that; I'm very far apart politically from DMN.)

I'm old and gray, enjoy reading and thinking, and always enjoy being told I'm wrong. So this is the perfect blog!

As a youth, I was told I was wrong to participate in 4-H club events, because only future farmers do such things. As a very young speechwriter, using a 4-H scholarship to pay for college, I was told I was wrong to lend my assistance to a right-wing conservative minister. As a computer scientist, using my speechwriting income to fund my business, I was told I was wrong to even think about web-based electronic mail and other frivolous fads. As a law student, I was told I was wasting my time, as such skills wouldn't affect my business. As a university administrator, I was told I was wrong to implement Ethernet in dorm rooms, for who but a scientist would ever need anything more than a 9600 baud modem? And as a blog comment-er, I was told I was wrong when I wrote that Obamacare must be lawful, for it is nothing more than a tax.

I'm old and gray... but not too much. Jenny Joseph penned the best description (see https://www.barbados.org/poetry/wheniam.htm ).

I'm a 35 year old lawyer in the Bay Area of California, moderately liberal by Bay Area standards, probably raging lefty by Midwest and Southern standards. I've been reading VC since 2006 as a 1L. I was initially drawn to what was, at the time, a very diverse and thoughtful commentariat across the spectrum (think DMN and NToJ) and learned quite a bit from the comments (seriously, where else on the Internet can anyone say that with a straight face?). Gradually moved away during the WaPo years because of the ever increasing paywall and the dramatic shift in commenters (as trolls of all stripes crawled out of woodwork of WaPo). Glad you're on Reason and hoping to start re-engaging in the comments section.

I'm a practicing civil litigator in Minneapolis, Minnesota (writing under a pseudonym). I started reading the blog regularly in about 2003, when I was still a law student.

I grew up poor to a single mother in a small town, where I developed a healthy distrust of government busybodies. But I also have a lot of sympathy for poor people, who often try to make a go of it, but are stymied by liberal do-gooders who try to manage their decisions. Part of respecting people means respecting their right to make bad decisions.

And I'm probably the only person who misses WaPo (which I could access thanks to a university email account). At least there I could sort though to find quality, substantive comments without having to scroll through dozens of trolling screeds, often with a sprinkling of covert (and sometimes overt) racist comments.

Favourite topics are anything historical or legal theory or free speech. Also the Short Circuit posts. Least favourite ones are repeated posts on the same issue without anything new to say, that start to become more political advocacy than enlightenment.

Retired 60ish Software Developer here.

I've been reading VC since at least Oct 2003 (that's the first email I can find in which I forwarded a link to VC). I probably wouldn't have become aware of the blog for quite some time if I hadn't noticed Eugene's name associated with it and remembered being very impressed with Eugene when I met him sometime before he entered law school.

I thought about becoming a lawyer mid-career, but I was pretty sure I'd take a big pay cut (in addition to the educational costs - both tuition and opportunity loss) as I'm not the type of person suited for Big Law.

Politically, I consider myself a "bad libertarian" because my beliefs are probably closer to libertarian than any other mainstream political group. However, "True" Libertarians generally think I'm a communist, liberals think I'm a right wing nut case, conservatives think I'm amoral, and progressives think I'm heartless (all, by the way, are wrong in their assessments).

I'm a strong supporter of the Second Amendment because it is there in clear text and shouldn't be treated as if it were written in invisible ink as it was for many decades -- that alone is enough reason to defend it vigorously lest other more important aspects of the Constitution fall victim to the same treatment.

Last, I'm thankful that in 2018 I will no longer have to circumvent the WP paywall - thanks. (I'm not thankful for the 1500 character limit on comments though).

I work for the US Census bureau asking around 18 households a month about their experiences with crime, and I edit papers for engineering professors before they submit them for publication.

I stumbled on VC only 2-3 years ago at the Washington Post. I mainly lurk, occasionally comment, /very/ occasionally get involved in extended discussion or debate. I miss the 'like' button.One of my favorite things was going through the comments and up-voting those that were thoughtful or provided interesting information, even if -- maybe especially if -- I disagreed with the writer. People need to know folks listen to them.

Me. I'm a retired sociologist who still researches the historical demography of violence. I didn't leave sociology; it left me. 25 years at a state university in South Carolina led me to conclude the South isn't so bad. Four years in Maryland and Northern Virginia led me to conclude that the folks there have /no/ idea how controlled their lives are. I comment at other sites using my real name. I'd do it here, but I kind of like the Mercutio quote (even if the original is "A plague o' both your houses"), because I'm torn between positions I can't accept. My exception is the First Amendment, on which I'm firm.

My memory may be playing tricks on me but I'm sure I first came across the blog prior to law school, when I was reading everything I could on Harry Potter in the leadup to Deathly Hallow's release, including David Kopel's Severus Snape articles. I started law school right around that time, and kept right on reading.

I'm currently a state appellate law clerk and I don't doubt that my enjoyment of the appellate blogsphere--is that term still used?--played a part in my landing spot. I had another career before law school and was comfortable with my decision to go back to school, but my enjoyment of this and related sites reaffirmed my decision.

Am posting way more info than anyone ever should on the Internet, where it would probably take about five seconds to find out my identity and a lot more. But *they* probably know anyway.

Tax/estate planning lawyer/something of a general practitioner at a big (originally Boston-based) law firm and its now (sort of) successor since the late 70s. Grew up on the South Side of Chicago, where I still have millions of relatives (in the area, but no longer on the South Side or even in the city), and went to Ignatius before attending college and law school "near Boston" (if you know what I mean). Have lived in the Fenway since 1980. Just reached the "will you still need me/will you still feed me" stage last month.

Stumbled on VC maybe ten years ago, either via Althouse (still visiting regularly) or Instapundit (not). I think I've commented a couple of times, probably on math or language stuff or the like.

Randy B. (who's largely disappeared?) is more or less exactly of the same origin/vintage, but a North Sider. Probably a Cubs fan, sigh, if he even cares (which I really don't any more, but can't deny my South Side/White Sox heritage).

Love Eugene and Sasha's stuff. Ilya's been a bit too much TDS for the last year or so. The rest don't make as much of an impression.

Someday I might write a longer article about how cop pensions are ruining the State of California.

MikeStarrWriter|1.3.18 @ 6:12AM|#

My name is Mike Starr and I'm a technical writer (both contract and freelance) living about halfway between Chicago and Milwaukee. I've been following the Volokh Conspiracy for many years, well before the switch to the Washington Post. I don't recall how I first encountered it but suspect it might have been via a link from 3QuarksDaily.

I have developed a fascination with Constitutional law and especially enjoy the discussions of Supreme Court cases. Being a seasoned writer, I'm impressed with the writing of the contributors and the amount of effort they put into their articles. I seldom browse the comments but if I do, I almost never add a comment.

For the most part, I consider myself a libertarian but sometimes I'm more liberal and other times I'm more conservative. My perspective is that while I was married, my wife and I never agreed 100%. If one cannot agree 100% with someone he loves, it's normal not to agree 100% with any particular political philosophy. I do make a fairly determined effort to keep myself informed about political positions from other perspectives and have found that I have sometimes changed my own position as a result.

I read VC so as to gain insight into legal matters that is more than the 1" deep analysis provided by the daily media.

I am a software architect by trade, hymn writer, friend to interesting people regardless of age or station, and emergency tenor.

In one of the internet start-ups I worked on, we had an attorney as our CEO (we were building a chain-of-custody system for digital chattel paper). I learned then that lawyers are trained to find holes and work-arounds, not to build new things. So, it was a bit of a disaster.

I've been a long-time reader of the Conspiracy, mainly because 1) I like serious discussions by serious people, and 2) I'm still trying to understand how lawyers think.

The details of my life are quite inconsequential. My father was a relentlessly self-improving boulangerie owner from Belgium with low grade narcolepsy and a penchant for buggery. My mother was a fifteen year old French prostitute named Chloe with webbed feet. My father would womanize, he would drink. He would make outrageous claims like he invented the question mark. Sometimes he would accuse chestnuts of being lazy. The sort of general malaise that only the genius possess and the insane lament.

My childhood was typical. Summers in Rangoon, luge lessons. In the spring we'd make meat helmets. When I was insolent I was placed in a burlap bag and beaten with reeds- pretty standard really. At the age of twelve I received my first scribe. At the age of fourteen a Zoroastrian named Vilma ritualistically shaved my testicles. There really is nothing like a shorn scrotum... it's breathtaking- I highly suggest you try it.

Or... I'm (mostly) a real estate and estate litigation attorney. Started reading on and off in law school. Became a dedicated reader around 2012. Used to post under a different name on the original site. A law nerd in general, which makes this site pretty much a must-read.

I am an engineer in Seattle, Wa. I have been following The Volokh Conspiracy for a few years now, to keep abreast of current judicial news and analysis. I have had to do some legal research years ago and came across the page regarding California laws and self defense after my wife was raped while I was away on deployment during Operation Just Cause in Panama. My wife and I were both denied concealed carry permits after the assault and I had to find an effective solution for self defense for her while I am away on deployments. Ultimately, I made the decision we would carry concealed without permit after determining that the applicable law we were breaking would result in a misdemeanor charge if we were ever caught.

Stumbling across this site opened my eyes to the complexity of law to include very simple laws that cannot be clearer, but are impacted by many other factors such as relative legal precedents and decisions that when applied to a simply worded law, we find it can be argued persuasively that a banana is not really a banana but is actually a ham sandwich. The Volokh Conspiracy contributors call the absurdity of these arguments out in some of the extreme examples.

I've been visiting for a number of years, I came here originally either via a link or a search about a legal or political issue. I am a US citizen living in Canada (grew up here) so I only vote in US Federal elections. I'm not libertarian, more centrist (mostly Democrat in the sense of thinking they generally do slightly less harm and religiously I'm inclined to have a problem with harsh immigration laws, but I have voted Republican in the past) except on a few mostly free speech, social and drug-use (including pain relief) issues, but like others have posted, I like reading intelligent arguments that make me think about and sometimes change or moderate my positions.

Work-wise, I practice forensic engineering (failure analysis, expert witness work) my second career after having practiced IP litigation for a few years and deciding I wanted to do something I found more fulfilling (albeit lower-paying), though I still practice litigation part-time for interest's sake (I wasn't a fan of the business of law, but liked the other things about the practice of law). I am admitted in New York as well as in Ontario, Canada, so I hope I have a better understanding of US law than average, but I don't advise anyone regarding NY or US law!

I started reading long before your move to the Washington Post (so perhaps more than seven years ago). My interest in the blog is its being probably the best place on the internet to find high-quality conservative legal thought.

Following this blog has influenced my writing style, both in English and Spanish. Also, many good ideas that originally appeared here have ended up in some form (and with the obvious adaptations) in my briefs before Spanish courts (with satisfactory results, I must say).

This is not the only American legal blog I follow. I also read Dorf on law, Balkinization or Lawfare.

Happy New Year! I was minding my own business on my turnip farm when I found you all over at the original Volokh Conspiracy. I don't remember when that was or where I was living at the time. Living in the DC area made the Washington Post a natural source of news, although most of my time reading their site was spent at your blog. Turnip farming in DC is a good learning experience. I work on large scale farm where I mostly sort the turnips. I get to attend DC-events which is fun but I roll my eyes at the "what do you do?" culture of this place.

I'm a 51-year-old prosecutor (and current candidate for my boss's job.) I've been following Volokh since pretty close to its inception.

Over the last two years, I have read it less due to WaPo's increasingly onerous paywall and the disintegration of the comments section. (Here at Reason, it seems better, which is not what I would have predicted.)

I'm a big fan, and commented occasionally on the original site. Other notes: I like the slatestarcodex blog, I once talked to the police as a suspect and it was a *really* good idea to have done so, and I published the first piece showing that pitcher projections could be improved by factoring in velocity.

Jeff Walden|1.4.18 @ 4:35AM|#

I'm going to try to guess: The reason it was good to talk, was that you led to look for certain evidence that would have been gone by the time you pointed them in that direction in a distant future when you could consult an attorney? I've read/seen all the usual books/videos about not talking to the police, and they generally seem right, except for that big BUT when they could turn out to be wrong. Which BUT I feel like I should be able to recognize in at least some circumstances, but feel I probably shouldn't trust my ability to recognize, in the moment, very much.

Never had any run-ins with police, myself, except for traffic accidents, then one time when I (not thinking very clearly) consented to a search of a bag I was carrying. But I was on my way back from the airport with a bag I'd packed myself and knew what was in it, so the sorts of potential risks to a search were definitely on the low side.

Without Volkh one to many speech article i'd probably be in jail.

The contempt article was filed but a timely appeal with a pretty good brief gave the judge a good reason to not issue.

Two months later that judge resigned, 7 months later appeal court reversed.

It was an interesting journey of early pleadings and motion shown a rambling prose respondent.

As I got into the appeals I notice my focus was much better. The motion to relinquish back to the court was/is seldom used but revealed a humble move to let the trial court fix. Opposing counsel fought it. Appeals kept jurisdiction and then reversed.

I went from like a prelaw student to a fairly well versed litigant. Even the appellant formatting turned out quite well, suprisingly. Didnt call the judge or opponents idiots once in my brief but the facts pointed that way.

Read Volokh's Academic Legal Writing, and Samples of Appellant Briefs and attacked the job before me growing into, by the appellant brief and forward, a well seasoned adversary.

You ever in a bind on the issues written by this blog including Sasha Volokh on regulation and licensing dive deep and by the time finished you will cap off 8 years of law school with real world theory toward awesome arguments.

At http://www.dueprocessday.com you can find all the ramblings until the appellant brief where the efforts and studying revealed itself. Where the opinion came REVERSED, and the mandate issued and the appellee paid all apeals costs.

Also: cats. My husband and I made a deal years ago that he could get a leather recliner if I could get a cat. Now we have two cats (I imported the second, a foster my mom had in MD), and the leather recliner does show a certain amount of claw damage, but we are one small happy family.

...okay, more seriously. :-)

I think I now (unlike the last time we had this kind of thread) can claim to be a long-time reader, since 2009. Software engineer at Mozilla by trade, working on the JavaScript implementation in Firefox.

I gained a hobbyist interest in law from an ethics-and-public-policy-and-computers undergrad class at MIT taught by Hal Abelson. Around which time I began to read the occasional Supreme Court opinion or brief, and I listened to oral arguments in Baze v. Rees shortly after their early release. Somewhat after that I started regularly reading SCOTUSblog, then adding in the Volokh Conspiracy to the mix made things really take off. There's very little VC people post about that I don't find interesting enough to read completely. Even the goofy procedural goo and ad-law is neat! And some particular subject areas Conspirators dive into deeply -- the First Amendment, the Second Amendment, the Fourth Amendment -- mesh well with my own deeper interests.

Jeff Walden|1.4.18 @ 3:58AM|#

[...continued...]

At this point I've probably read dozens of Supreme Court briefs and opinions, I've made the trip to DC with the sole purpose of attending an interesting Supreme Court oral argument (or arguments) (or with the additional purpose of picking up one of eleven different Green Bag SCOTUS bobbleheads I own) -- I've been to fourteen of them at this point. (Including such highlights as NLRB v. Noel Canning, McCullen v. Coakley, Holt v. Hobbs, IMO Heien v. North Carolina, Walker v. Texas Sons of Confederate Veterans, and Matal v. Tam [nee Lee]). I spend way more time reading and thinking about law than I have any justification for doing. :-)

Had I discovered my interest in law before senior year in college (by that point well into a remunerative field of study), I would almost certainly have considered law school. But by the time I realized it, I was well qualified for well-paying jobs. Money doesn't really motivate that much, anyway. And spending $200k, and (much worse) losing three years of my life, to go to law school, just isn't going to be in the cards now. (Even if something like patent examiner would make up the money, nothing will make up the time.)

I'm in IT Operations and have been reading Volokh since it was on its own website. Putting the difficulty of one dimensional labels aside: I have migrated politically from a NeoConservative to more of maybe a Fusionist/Paleoconservative. In my lifetime now, I have seen how the ever expansive role of politics destroy almost everything it touches.

Everything I have read over the last ten years makes me believe that the precepts of the United States Constitution are relevant. It is an incredibly prescient document designed as a stumbling block to tyranny.

I am opposed to how the US approaches immigration, which to my mind has been executed to the benefit of big business and the electoral interests of the democrat party and to the detriment of limited government and the wishes of the citizenry.

I am on the fence about legalized drugs and I see the topic as a large libertarian contradiction: There is certainly a states rights issue here, but how do you keep the public from having to pick up the check for the damage to society that I am certain would increase?

I think the two biggest threats to our Republic is the growing number of enemies of the First Amendment and the debt.

In my non-expert view, the authors of Volokh Conspiracy I find myself mostly agreeing with are probably Professors Volokh and Adler, the one I have the hardest time "gisting" with or understanding would be Professor Somin.

Greetings,
IANAL. While I took a Cyber Law course from the National Defense University, the biggest effect that class had on me was to show that I do better with computers than law. (My best friend is an over-achiever; he has a BSEE, an MBA, a JD, and a DO: Not a beggar man, thief, or Indian Chief - but fits the other categories: rich man, poor man, doctor, &amp; lawyer.)

I am a Security Engineer for the U.S. Army at Ft. Huachuca, AZ - best place to live, so stay away.

I enjoy reading Volokh Conspiracy, and have been doing so for a couple of years - before the move to the Washington Post. I'm glad you've moved on to the Reason site, though for some of your posters, I wonder how comfortable they'll feel. Part of the reason I enjoy reading the VC is that it shows me how many ways there are to think about a given topic - my way, your way, the courts' way, and so forth. Sometimes, I find my original opinion (where I actually have one) validated; other times, I have to think about my opinion - am I right or off-kilter? Was it a knee-jerk thought, or had I actually considered other possible aspects of (whatever the issue at hand is). Sometimes, I almost want to go through the screen at the author - others, not so much.

Please stay safe - and keep up the good work.

I'm a Reasonoid who reads this every now and then when I notice it. By trade I'm a recent Ph.D in machine learning, and I've just started a new job that will hopefully entail further research in that area.

My original background before switching to computers was Philosophy, but I ended up disliking the atmosphere of academic Philosophy that I quickly switched out to other work. I read less of that then I used to, but I still hold little bits of passion for Kierkegaard. I've also been getting into the Catholic authors.

My true passion though is arguing with people online and making confusing jokes that makes people think I'm a troll.

So, thank you for reading my blog.

How to compress 65 years into a paragraph?

Born 1951. Read Rand in 1967, but not able to stand her since. UC Santa Barbara 1970-74. Had some exposure to the ARPANET then. Met some "Reason" people in the area. Studied physics. Joined a small company named Intel. Had good results there. Retired in 1986. (Not sure it was retirement then, but various investments made it so.) Developed interest in implications of cryptography, digital currencies. Co-founded "Cypherpunks" group in 1992. Met some of you on Trotter Hardy's "Cyberlaw" list in 1990s when I could help educate some law professors--stuff was pretty new to many back then. Still involved in things like Bitcoin, applications of math. Less so in most "law" issues. Occasional commenter on this group, but mostly not much interested in online debate anymore.

Correction: I now recall that the list was called "Cyberial-l" or something like that, not "Cyberlaw."

Anyway, a lot of the "early" (1990s) cyberlaw discussion took place on that list, circa 1993-95.

As a liberty freak and business person, law has been of considerable interest to me. Yours and, Lawliberty are sites I frequent for law. I often share articles from either on Facebook, as I have a deluded wish to wake people up.

Thanks for what you guys do, even if you aren't ideal AnCaps. LOL. Well, neither am I, but I'm closer to it that you are.

I am an attorney and CPA, with an LL.M in Taxation, now involved in writing computer software. I arrived here a couple of years ago after reading a book by Tim Groseclose on the use of Race in Admissions at UCLA. He mentioned that it was only after his report was the subject of an article in the Volokh Conspiracy that it really started getting a lot of national attention.

I like the high quality of the articles on this blog and also the high quality of many of the comments. There seem to be fewer utterly inane comments than are sometimes found on other blogs. No doubt this is partly due to some intelligent administration.

I miss the up-vote as well, though I don't miss having to go through and expand all the comments in order to search them.

I also miss the WaPo feature that will bring up all of one's posts and show replies, incomplete as it was since only replies to posts at the first two levels were shown, and only replies above the "View more replies" line. Disqus is much better than either WaPo or Reason at allowing a person to locate both his posts and replies to them. But Disqus has its own problems in that one cannot scroll through them and count on seeing them all. I'd be curious to hear views on which blogs have the best software for the kind of comments we see at Volokh, and what features people think are the most useful.

Kazinski is a nickname I got at work named after Ted Kaczynski, because when I was building my cabin on the weekends I described my shed and construction bunkhouse as a Kaczynski cabin. I finished building my real cabin now so the Kaczynski cabin has been dismantled but the name stuck. But my cabin is off the grid, and fairly remote, but it does have 17 skylights so I don't have to have a lot of power to make it livable.

I'm a 70 year old trying-to-be-retired surgeon--but keep getting asked for medical opinions, etc. Also serial entrepreneur and teacher/prof.

Raised by lawyers, though, which is probably the source of infection with legal interests, esp. constitutional ones: mom was a criminal lawyer addicted to trial and never had a guilty client (I started to write "patient")--until one day she recognized the voice of the guy who had stolen her car at gunpoint while she was trying on dresses. Consistency wasn't her long suit: she insisted that Dad not take him as a client--but she didn't volunteer to burn him. Dad was the ultimate 4A expert and plea bargainer. All this was in New Orleans, much of it in the Jim Garrison era. Diner table conversations never lacked for color. Gentility sometimes went light, but never interest. Each conversation involved cross-examine the kids.

Been reading VC for about the past 10-12 years. Usually very good and thought-provoking.

Started commenting on the Volokh Conspiracy around 2011. With the transition to the WP, mostly stopped commenting at that point because if you auto-delete their cookies to painlessly ignore their paywall, it's a hassle to re-enable them just to be able to login and comment. I understood the decision, but glad to see you guys at Reason instead.

Pretty sure I haven't missed reading any published article here in the last 6-7 years. It's on my regular rotation to visit. Autodidact and constitutional law and/or legal interpretation are one of my areas of interest. Own some of the more obscure academic legal books by the Conspirators.

Politically, lean toward Anarcho-Capitalist/Voluntarist, but not an extremist/purist and so happy to support most people/ideas which lead towards greater liberty. Grew up in southern CA, made it to AZ via Northern VA, likely heading for NC for a few years very soon.

Technologist by employment, Systems Architect by nature, so very interested in systems design and behavior, which to me includes people systems such as legal systems as well computer hardware, software, networks, roads, etc... For my day job, I manage a team to take care of one of the largest (in terms of numbers of network devices and circuits) internal corporate networks in the world which doesn't belong to a telecom company.

Also a fiction writer, soccer player/coach/referee, married with 4 kids, love military and political history, etc... Mostly a generalist with a few specialties.

A nuclear engineer from north Alabama and worked in a nuclear plant for 35 years. I note that there are many engineers that follow your columns. The latter half of my career dealt with directly interfacing with the NRC, which is the regulatory agency for nuclear plants. So I am familiar with the federal rule-making process and the various other vehicles that regulatory agencies use to impose changes on industries. And it's mostly the other vehicles. On the side, I have in interest in constitutional law and been reading your blogs for a number of years. I have a son who is a lawyer and my best friend is a trial lawyer so we often have quite vigorous debates concerning legal matters. Always thought your move to Wapo was an odd fit and though you were gracious in leaving as you should be, I suspect it was in the end – it was an odd fit. But glad you're back in the blogosphere with perhaps added flexibility.

Hello Eugene,

It's been quite a number of years since we've spoken. I'm still working in software development but haven't seen or touched an HP computer in over 20 years (other than my laptop). I honestly can't recall when we last spoke (I think I actually spoke to your mother more recently about buying Vesoft) so I'll just make it brief. Galia and I moved back to Israel about 10 months ago, this time for keeps. We live in a small village called Moreshet and are building a house here. I'm working for an Israeli company called Visuality Systems. Great job, lots of fun.

I've been following your blog for a number of years now originally due to my 2nd Amendment interests but more recently I've learned a lot about many other subjects. We of course had to sell our rather nice gun collection as importing private firearms is not legal. I'm hoping to get an Israeli carry permit as soon as possible (another 2 year wait required).

If you have never been to Israel then you must come here for a vacation. I'd love to show you around or just have a cup of coffee/tea with you.

May you continue to have much success with your work.

Sincerely Yours,
Joe Berry

Haven't participated in a 'who are you' threads before; reading through the comments is interesting. There's some esteemed company reading here (which I always suspected, and now see as confirmed).

I'm married to my college sweetheart, in my mid-30s, and a graduate of UCLA's undergrad political science program. I came close to applying to law school out of undergrad (took the LSAT, scored decently), but decided to get some work experience first, and just continued on instead of going back to school. I worked for the City of Los Angeles for about a decade, and now work for the City of San Diego. In both cities I worked as a policy analyst*, largely focused on those cities' public works, environmental, and water programs, but at various times I've also worked on elections, redistricting, ethics regulations, and budgeting. I've been reading the VC for at least a decade or so now, though not entirely sure when I first came across it.

Hobbies/interests include technology and computers (I was brought up by two computer engineer parents), ancient history, literature, tinkering, home repairs, cider making, and reading less-technical legal works. My politics started out as pretty close to libertarian, but they've since softened in an left/right sense while hardening into a belief that local government should take precedence over national government as it's generally closer and more responsive to the people it serves (though given my career, of course I would say this).

*'Policy Analyst' is the rough job title, but the job involves more than just providing analysis - I work with elected officials, department heads/staff, and public interest groups to make and adjust policies, implement programs, etc, on top of just writing analyses of various topics and programs.

I started reading this website about 6-7 years ago in law school, prior to the move to the WAPO.

I now work as an attorney with a primary focus on civil litigation - mostly in the realm of torts, but I also am fortunate enough to be able practice some 1A law.

I tend to like the wide range of views of the various posters.

I'm a long-time VC reader, though less so during the WP years, and more often during periods when you were writing about cases I was working on. I retired in 2017 after more than 40 years in the Federal Programs Branch of the Justice Department's Civil Division.

Mathematician by training; Philosopher/Classicist by inclination; CompSci/Programmer by trade; Family Man by desire; Lawyer Wannabe by necessity.

Got dragged into the legal arena by being plaintiff in employment case. That case was falsely dismissed at Summary Judgment: criminal conduct by the judges (Falsification of Facts, Obstruction of Justice, Cover-Up, Fraud Upon the Courts by Judges).

Therefore became (lay-)expert in Judicial Misconduct (esp. S.J. abuse). Maintain a website for that purpose, trying to raise awareness of that major issue, and activate/organize against it. Not as easy as it sounds, because the Legal Establishment as a whole (as opposed each/every individual practitioner) depends on the status quo illegality/unconstitutionality for its livelihood.

See my website for the Full Story. Ask Me Anything, publicly or privately.

I'm Jake Boone, a city councilor in Cottage Grove, Oregon, and treasurer of the League of Oregon Cities. I'm not sure how long I've been a reader, but I remember when you moved to the Washington Post, so I started at some point before that. Needless to say, I'm a fan.

I've been reading the VC since 2004. I am presently a labor lawyer for a DOD component agency. In the past I have been a Public Defender, commercial litigator and the owner of a small family law practice. This is my first comment at the VC, be it at Volokh.com, WaPo or now at Reason.

VC is one of the few legal blogs I have visited where the reader comments have been mostly insightful and stimulating. When you guys moved to WaPo, I got a digital subscription solely to read the VC. Unfortunately, the user commentary devolved into something unreadable. Hopefully the move to Reason will see a reversion to a more intellectual, and less emotional/political discussion.

Masked Professor|1.11.18 @ 7:03PM|#

I am a media law professor at a state university. Earned a PhD from a university that has a PhD/JD program. Never finished the JD part because as a former journalist, my main interest is freedom of expression, privacy, copyright, etc. I really love the law but had no intention of becoming a lawyer. I found a lot of the stuff about the legal profession, procedural law, and so on, really boring. I grew up in a British Commonwealth jurisdiction where lawyers pepper their submissions with Latin expressions and call each other "my learned friend!" Picked up French media law along the way.

I have been a tenured professor at state universities in New England, the Midwest, and now Texas. I research and publish on comparative and international media law (the US, France, EU &amp; Africa) with a focus on Internet law. I have followed VC since 2008 and find it very level-headed and informative. It is my go-to location for interpretation of American First Amendment law. The contributions of Eugene Volokh and Orrin Kerr are always very insightful. I have made some of EV's posts on hate speech required reading in my classes. Merci messieurs!
