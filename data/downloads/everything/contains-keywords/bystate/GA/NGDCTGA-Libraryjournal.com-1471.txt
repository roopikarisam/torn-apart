Library Journal Reviews


Previews, Reviews, and Collection Development

It's time again for LJ’s annual Top Ten Best Books of the year, selected by our editors, as well as Top Five lists for genre fiction, nonfiction, poetry and literature, graphic novels, and SELF-e titles.   SEE WHO MADE THE LIST

The Government Publishing  Office (GPO) in 2017 saw major activity. It completed the digitization of the Congressional Record and named four new depository libraries: Zach S. Henderson Library, Georgia Southern University, Statesboro; Pope County Library, Russellville, AR; Fort Stockton Public Library, TX; and Allen County Public Library, Fort Wayne. Fourteen libraries signed Memoranda of Agreement to join the Preservation Partnerships Program, in which individual depositories can pledge to retain and preserve specific documents or collections and provide permanent no-fee public access.

The GPO also saw turnover in important roles: in ­October, Laurie Hall was officially appointed Super­intendent of Documents (SD) after having served in an acting capacity since April 2016. She oversees the Library Services and Content Management Operations, which includes the Federal Depository Library Program (FDLP) and the Cataloging and Index Program.

In November, GPO director Davita Vance-Cooks left for work in the private sector. Vance-Cooks was confirmed by the Senate in 2013 as the nation’s 27th Public Printer—the first woman and first African American to serve in the post. Her focus was on modernizing the agency. GPO deputy director Jim Bradley took over as acting director until his retirement in March 2018; he was succeeded by GPO chief of staff Andrew M. Sherman, who will serve as acting deputy director.

UPDATING CODE

Throughout 2017, Vance-Cooks continued to lead ­lobbying effort to reform Title 44 of the U.S. Code, which defines the mission and responsibilities of the GPO and FDLP. Several previous attempts to legislate change were frustrated by budgetary issues and politics.

HR 5305, the FDLP Modernization Act of 2018, was introduced on March 15 and referred to the Committee on House Administration and the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. The legislation largely reflects recommendations of the depository library community, including strong affirmations of the public’s right to no-fee access to government information and that depository libraries are an effective means of providing that access.

HR 5305 introduces the term information dissemination products (IDPs) and affirms that any recorded information in any format falls under the jurisdiction of the Superintendent of Documents.

It authorizes the SD to establish a national collection of IDPs and provide permanent public access through an online repository established and operated by the GPO director. The national collection is also defined to include collections housed in the nation’s depository libraries and in the electronic collections of federal documents that reside on servers at academic and public libraries, museums, and digitization initiatives such as Google Books, the HathiTrust, Project Gutenberg, and the Internet Archive.

HR 5305 charges the heads of federal agencies and offices to provide electronic and tangible IDPs for inclusion in the national collection. It authorizes the SD to establish a comprehensive catalog of metadata for all historical IDPs that includes hyperlinks to those digitized by nonfederal entities. It also formalizes the Preservation Partnership Program.

HR 5305 represents the strongest congressional affirmation yet of our principles and role. Though at press time it had yet to pass a single committee, the depository library community remains hopeful and confident.

Best Practices for Collecting Onsite Data To Assess Recreational Use Impacts from an Oil Spill. by E. Horsch &amp; others. 2017. U.S. Dept. of Commerce, National Oceanic &amp; Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Technical Memorandum NOS OR&amp;R 54. Assessment &amp; Restoration Div. 2017. online. 121p. https://doi.org/10.7289/V5/TM-NOS-ORR-54

On April 20, 2010, 41 miles off the coast of Louisiana in the Gulf of Mexico, an explosion and subsequent fire aboard BP’s Deepwater Horizon drilling rig led to the largest offshore oil spill in U.S. history.

This manual provides guidance on methods and considerations for collecting such data.
