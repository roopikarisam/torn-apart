Very Vary Veri is a student run journal coming from Harvard's GSD that publishes archival material found at the Loeb Library alongside newly commissioned pieces; their latest, Issue 3, explores the theme of Exile. 

For this iteration of Screen/Print, we are sharing an included essay by Kathleen James-Chakraborty, an art history professor at University College Dublin. In it, James-Chakraborty reflects on America's early generation of refugee architects—Walter Gropius, Marcel Breuer, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Erich Mendelsohn, to name a few—who came to the U.S. and forever shaped its built environment. 




It is estimated that about one-fifth of architects and engineers in the U.S. today are foreign-born. Looking at the construction industry, another extremely vital part of building buildings, 28% of the workforce is comprised of adoptive citizens. Yet, when discussing current issues of immigration, the idea of the architect as immigrant is often missing. As Ali Karimi reminds in this issue's Editor's Note, "over-designed refugee shelters, pavilions, or housing projects turn the migrant or refugee from a subject of humanitarian disaster to an unwitting client and consumer of architectural services. Yet the relationship of the architect to the exile was not always so opportunistic; throughout much of the 20th century the architect and the exile were often one and the same." 

Throughout the United States' architectural history, many of its greatest influencers have been those born outside the country's lines. Whether from Germany or Finland or beyond, the 20th century saw a slew of architectural talent arrive on our shores, sometimes by choice and sometimes not. Either way, they made the best of their circumstances and continued their architectural pursuits. In the following essay, Kathleen James-Chakraborty takes a look at these key figures and the ways in which they, and their architectural legacies, were welcomed. 



Exiled and Immigration

By Kathleen James-Chakraborty

Few American professions have been as
welcoming of immigrants, including those
forced into exile, as architecture. From
Benjamin Latrobe and Paul Cret through
Rudolph Schindler and Eliel Saarinen to
Denise Scott Brown and Toshiko Mori, an
impressive array of American architectural
talent has not been homegrown. Of the
 fifty-three winners of the Gold Medal of
the American Institute of Architects who
practiced in the United States, seventeen
were born abroad. The new arrivals with the
greatest impact upon 20th century American
architecture came as refugees rather than
voluntarily. Walter Gropius, Marcel Breuer,
Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Lilly Reich, and
Erich Mendelsohn all arrived between 1937
and 1941; only Reich returned to Germany. The choices that these key figures in the
invention of an industrial aesthetic made were
highly personal, but gender, age, and religion
also determined the opportunities that greeted
them, as did the choice of city in which to settle.
Having the right champions mattered far more
than the commitment to integration being
demanded of many contemporary migrants to
Europe. It also outweighed the extent of one’s
network. Philip Johnson and the Museum of Modern Art proved the most effective
sponsors, but the museum’s favors were doled
out unevenly and did not always spur public
acceptance. Mies and Breuer were far more
successful in their adopted homeland than
Gropius or Mendelsohn, not entirely because
they were at this point in their careers more
talented architects, but also because they and
their supporters were able to integrate them
into stories that told those Americans who
cared what they wanted to hear.

Professional education in architecture
began in the United States only in the middle of the 19th century, long after it became available
in France and Germany. Moreover, even in
England, where the system of apprenticeship
predominated into the 20th century, there was a laying on of hands that was difficult to
develop on the far side of the Atlantic. And
yet, especially after the onset of the Industrial
Revolution, there was an enormous need for
buildings as the new nation expanded rapidly. This encouraged talented men with the
requisite skills to immigrate; many, beginning
with Latrobe, found a great deal of prestigious
work. Once architecture schools began to be established, the experience of European
pedagogues was highly valued, but even before
this European-born and educated architects
were particularly likely to succeed when they
were already familiar with new styles that
potential patrons had seen for themselves in
Europe or read about in journals and books.
Richard Upjohn and John Notman, who came
from Britain, and Adolf Kluss and Leopold
Eidlitz, born and trained in German-speaking
central Europe, were key figures in importing
the Gothic Revival to a country that had no
Gothic heritage of its own.

By the beginning of the 20th century,
however, American architecture was
experimental enough to attract new talent
who wanted to move away from what they
increasingly saw as the confines of Europe’s
architectural heritage rather than simply export
it to new shores. Rudolf Schindler and his
friend Richard Neutra, arrived respectively in 1914 and 1923, drawn above all by their
admiration for Frank Lloyd Wright. Eliel
Saarinen also arrived in 1923. He rightly
sensed that Finland, which had just achieved
independence, was unlikely to present him
with commissions on the scale that he could
expect to receive in a land of skyscrapers like the
Chicago Tribune Tower, which many thought
he should had the chance to design.

Hitler’s ascent to power in 1933 did not
immediately push a cast of architects toward
American shores. The first important artistic
refugees to come as a result were Joseph and Anni Albers, who arrived already that year to
teach at Black Mountain College. Johnson,
who would provide key assistance to many of
the arrivals, helped them find their positions.
Gropius followed in 1937. Harvard had
considered Mies as well for the job of leading
its architecture department, but hired the
founding director of the Bauhaus instead,
who had been living in London since 1934.
Gropius in turn assisted a number of others in
coming to the United States. Among them was
Marcel Breuer, with whom he practiced until
1941. Mies accepted a position at the Armour
Institute of Technology (later the Illinois
Institute of Technology or IIT) in Chicago.
He moved to the United States permanently
in 1938. In 1939 Reich came to visit him there. She returned to Germany just after the
outbreak of the war. Mendelsohn, the first of
the five to leave Germany, fleeing already in
March 1933, was the last to settle in the United
States. In 1941 he left Jerusalem, where he had
settled after first living in London, frightened
by the advance of Rommel’s army.




It is not clear why Reich did not stay, but
certainly the personal as well as professional
relationship this talented furniture and
exhibition designer had with Mies must have
been unraveling. That they were not married
may also have been a factor. Mies’s wife was
still alive, and he never  led for a divorced,
although they had long lived apart. Such
particulars mattered. Otti Berger, a weaver who
had studied at the Bauhaus, was unable to join
her fiancé, the architect Ludwig Hilberseimer,
whom Mies brought with him to IIT, because
they had not been husband and wife; she
perished at Auschwitz in 1944. Spared by the
war, Reich died in Berlin in 1947 at the age of
sixty-two before she had had a chance to make a
significant contribution to postwar design.

If enthusiasm for integration or the extent
of one’s network determined success, then
Mendelsohn and Gropius would surely have
achieved more in the United States than Mies
or Breuer. Mendelsohn first traveled to the
United States in 1924, where he met, among
others, Lewis Mumford and Frank Lloyd
Wright, who would remain lifelong friends.
His book, Amerika: Bilderbuch eines Architekten
(America: Picturebook of an Architect), published
two years later, made him Germany’s expert on
the subject of modern American architecture. Upon his arrival, the Museum of Modern Art
immediately accorded him an exhibition, which
then toured the country, while Ely Jacques
Kahn kindly gave him space in his New York office. Mendelsohn quickly set on a camping
tour with his wife to learn more about his new
country. His files are full of photographs of pre-industrial American architecture, with which
he sought to familiarize himself.

None of this translated easily, however,
into making a major mark upon modern American architecture. Mendelsohn’s
American accomplishments included four
synagogues that helped define the future of this
building type at a time when American Jews
were assuming unprecedented responsibility
for the leadership of international Judaism.
His Maimonides Hospital in San Francisco
garnered much favorable press. And the
Russell House remains one of that city’s most
imposing modern villas. Yet none of these
buildings display the panache of his best
German buildings, such as the Schocken stores
in Stuttgart and Chemnitz, much less the
Einstein Tower.




What went wrong? Some of what befell
Mendelsohn was simply bad timing. The
New York opening of his exhibition was
overshadowed by the news of Pearl Harbor.
He died in 1953 at the relatively young age of
sixty-six. But there were other factors at work
as well. Anti-Semitism was on the wane, but it
remained a factor. Breuer, although eventually
baptized, had been born Jewish, but neither
his name nor his biography emphasized his
religion. Mendelsohn, an ardent Zionist, had
lived in the British Mandate of Palestine, and throughout his career worked almost
exclusively for Jewish clients proud of his
capacity to represent the success of their
community. Although Mendelsohn’s
synagogues helped make this building type a
showcase of modern suburban architecture,
their location on the outskirts of four different
Midwestern cities, as well as their sacred
purpose, limited their ability to symbolize the
future of a secular democracy that had recently
ascended to the status of a world power.

Mendelsohn’s own earlier success also
proved an obstacle. One of the first people to
greet the German architect when he arrived in New York in 1924 was Norman Bel Geddes.
His popularization of streamlining owed more
than a little to Mendelsohn’s dynamic drawings
and buildings in Germany. Mendelsohn’s
most celebrated buildings in consequence no
longer seemed new. No one was more aware
of this than the architect himself, who sought
to join what appeared to be the cutting edge
of the contemporary American architectural
scene. In 1945 he moved to San Francisco and
began teaching at Berkeley even before his
friend William Wurster was appointed dean
of architecture in 1950. Mendelsohn’s Russell
House in San Francisco’s Pacific Heights of
1951 testifies to his desire to fit in. Although the
corner window facing out towards the Golden
Gate reprises one of the signature motifs of his
German department stores, the wood cladding and the Thomas Church garden nonetheless
make this a quintessential Bay Area house, very
much in the spirit, for instance, of the Wesley
Havens House in Berkeley, completed a decade
earlier. This approach put Mendelsohn on a
collision course with other German émigré
architects, particularly Breuer but also Gropius,
who were committed to maintaining the legacy
of the Bauhaus, even as they adopted it to
postwar purposes.

Gropius, nonetheless, also immediately sought to assimilate into a country he had first visited in 1928, fifteen years after he had published a sheaf of photographs of grain silos and daylight factories, many of them American structures, in the Werkbund Jahrbuch. His preferred photograph of himself, widely published at the time, showed him in front of an enormous drawing of his entry in the 1922 Chicago Tribune Tower competition. His house in Lincoln, Massachusetts, designed in collaboration with Breuer and completed in 1938, although it clearly shocked the neighbors, was intended to be respectful of the local tradition of white clapboard farmhouses, even as it retained the neatly clipped geometry of the director’s house he had built for himself a dozen years earlier in Dessau.

His base at Harvard gave Gropius a powerful position from which he wielded enormous influence over the next generation of American architects. He chaired the architecture department from 1938 until his retirement in 1952. He transformed the curriculum, with effects that rippled through most American and many other architecture schools for decades to come. He also attracted an enormously talented pool of students, whom he provided with the tools that enabled many of them to launch distinguished careers with unusual speed. Among the most notable were Edward Larrabee Barnes, John Johansen, Philip Johnson, I. M. Pei, Paul Rudolph, Benjamin Thompson, and Anne Tyng.




Not everything went smoothly, however.
For instance the exhibition in 1938 at the
Museum of Modern Art of work made at the Bauhaus during the years in which Gropius
was director he was not greeted with anywhere
near the acclaim for which he might have
wished, although the catalogue remained the
key publication on the school for decades to
come. Surrealism, not an industrial aesthetic,
appeared to be the new game in town at the
time, and in architecture, Frank Lloyd Wright’s
influence was at its peak, encouraging a respect
for specifically American settings quite at
odds with the cool abstraction displayed in
many of the works in a show that glossed quite
quickly over the school’s early experiments with
Expressionism.

Moreover, although Gropius’s final
architectural practice, The Architects
Collaborative (TAC), received an array
of prestigious commissions following its
establishment in 1946, none received the
warm reception accorded the best work of the
day. TAC included two women (Gropius had
opted for coeducation when men were in short
supply during the war), Jean Fletcher and Sarah
Harkness, among its founding partners. His new collaborators, all born in the 1910s,
were young enough to have been his children. The firm’s first major commission, for graduate
student housing at Harvard, completed in
1950, was overshadowed by the success of
Alvar Aalto’s Baker Hall at the neighboring
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. In comparison to Aalto’s sinuous and richly
textured forms, TAC’s graduate center, despite
the inclusion of a mural by Miro and a sculpture
by Richard Lippold, appeared slightly banal.
Gropius’s participation in the design of the
much-maligned Pan American (now MetLife)
building completed just north of New York’s
Grand Central Terminal in 1963 marked the
death knell of his reputation as an important
contemporary architect.

Gropius continued, however, to be a key figure in American and especially in German
architectural culture. He was active, sometimes
behind the scenes, sometimes not, in events
as varied as the creation of the Hansaviertel in
Berlin and the establishment of the Bauhaus Archiv in first Darmstadt and then Berlin.
Living until 1969, he had time to work on
shaping his legacy and to enjoy having it
acknowledged on both sides of the Atlantic.

Meanwhile Breuer, his erstwhile
collaborator, achieved real respect as a architect
of buildings that mattered to a postwar world.
Following the breakup of his partnership with
Gropius and the end of wartime restrictions
on construction that had encouraged him to
remain at Harvard, Breuer moved in 1946 to
New York. Far more than Boston, which had
ceded leadership of the national architectural
scene in the late 19th century, New York proved
fertile ground for launching what became an
international architectural practice. Breuer
was celebrated from the beginning for his
relatively modest houses, which displayed an
astute sense of how to infuse woodsy modern
dwellings of the kind proving popular on the
West Coast with the highly tactile abstraction
he had mastered as a student at the Bauhaus.
He also soon became one of the first architects
practicing in the United States to absorb the
lessons of Le Corbusier’s postwar experiments
in concrete.

Breuer also had the advantage of relative
youth. Born in 1902, Breuer was nearly a full
generation younger than Reich, Mendelsohn,
Gropius, and Mies, all children of the 1880s.
Although he had made a name for himself
already with furniture design in the 1920s,
he was not faced with the challenge of going
beyond recycling the work that had already
made him famous. His early postwar houses,
beginning with the first Geller House in Long
Island, completed in 1947, and including
the two dwellings he built for himself in the
Connecticut suburb of New Canaan, matched
the spirit of the times in their relatively small
scale and informal layout. Breuer’s talent for
texture, which extended as far as employing fieldstone for parts of their bases, gave these
dwellings a vigor that seemed anchored in the
quintessentially American work of Henry
Hobson Richardson and Wright, even as
the Bauhaus clearly provided a precedent for the cantilevered overhang of the second
New Canaan house in particular. On the
East Coast, which had witnessed little of the
experimentation in domestic architecture that
had taken place in California the interwar years,
they appeared especially fresh and new.

Being in New York also mattered because
it meant that the work was easily accessible
to important shapers of opinion in the field.
At a time when coast to coast airplane travel
remained an exotic experience (Mendelsohn
was one of the first architects to become a
frequent flyer), Breuer’s early independent
work was easily accessible to magazine editors
and museum curators, who did not have to
depend on photographs and plans to sense
his skill in framing unusually open spaces
in varied textures. In 1948 Breuer worked
closely with Johnson in organizing an event
at the Museum of Modern Art intended as a
rebuttal to Mumford’s championing of Bay
Area Regionalism (the term is something of
a misnomer, since similar work was erected
around the country and indeed in other parts
of the world). The following year Johnson
commissioned him to build an exhibition
house in the museum’s garden that garnered an
enormous amount of favorable publicity.





By the middle of the 1950s Breuer was
able to ratchet up the scale of his work in
commissions that also demonstrated the
geographic and typological reach of his
expanding practice. In Paris, he collaborated
with Bernard Zehrfuss and Pier Luigi Nervi on
the design of the headquarters for UNESCO,
completed in 1958. Meanwhile his St. John’s
Abbey Church in Collegeville, Minnesota,
part of a larger monastic and college complex
erected for this chapter of the Benedictine
order, completed in 1961, was already under
construction. One of the most monumental
modern churches ever erected in the United
States, it attracted international attention. The highly sculpted concrete of these and
many other Breuer buildings demonstrated his
familiarity with the work of Le Corbusier, even
if it depended even more on the engineering talents of Nervi. Breuer retained a strong sense
of his own identity however, in the Whitney
Museum on New York’s Madison Avenue. His
most celebrated late work, it was completed in 1966, fifteen years before his death in
1981. Here he crafted one of the few Brutalist
structures to gain an immediately public
following, as was demonstrated in the repeated
battles to resist disfiguring proposed additions.

Mies, however, was by far the most
successful German émigré in the history of
American architecture, entirely eclipsing even
Breuer (who was in fact a native of Hungary)
among those architects who fled the Third
Reich. Mies was not an obvious candidate at
the outset for this honor, and indeed he got
off to a slow start. Unlike Mendelsohn and
Gropius, he had not visited the United States
before the mid1930s, and he found it difficult to master English. The Armour Institute of
Technology was also much less prestigious
than Berkeley, let alone Harvard. Furthermore,
Mendelsohn, Gropius, and Breuer had all built significant structures in England in
the 1930s. This substantial body of work had
featured prominently in English magazines
and was thus known to many Americans.
Furthermore Mendelsohn had built extensively
in Mandate Palestine, although commissions
like the Hadassah Hospital on Mount Scopus
were more familiar to Jewish philanthropists
than American architects and critics. Mies,
by contrast, had built almost nothing in
Germany since 1933. Moreover, of the two most
significant buildings of his German career one,
the Barcelona Pavilion, was disassembled soon
after it was built while the other, the Tugendhat
House, was after 1945, located “behind the Iron Curtain,” to use the classic Cold War phrase
coined by Winston Churchill.

Nonetheless, by the early 1950s this gruff man, already at an age when most people
would consider retiring, had emerged as the
architect practicing in the United States whom
other architects held in the highest esteem, a
position he would solidify following Wright’s
departure from the scene in 1959 and retain
until his own demise a decade later. The first
choice Mies made would not initially have
seemed fortuitous. Harvard was much more
prestigious than Armour, but the latter proved
to have two major advantages. Although
Mies’s manner of teaching would never be as
influential as the curriculum Gropius instituted
at Harvard, being based in Chicago at an
institution about to build a new campus and able to continue its construction even during
the war both positioned him exceptionally
well. Chicago was a city with a large German
population, and the architecture school at
the University of Illinois had originally been
founded upon German rather than French
lines. In part in consequence, already at the
end of the nineteenth century its innovative
architecture was widely known in Berlin, where
Mendelsohn’s Mossehaus of 1923, designed in collaboration with Richard Neutra and
Paul Rudolf Henning, was an addition to a
Chicago-like building of 1901 by Cremer
and Wolffenstein. In Chicago, whether or not Wright greeted him warmly, Mies
could be positioned as the heir to these early
experiments in an internationally influential
American modernism. Furthermore, he did
not have to look hard to find work. Building
at IIT gave him the chance to commence long
before he had befriended powerful developers
or corporate clients.

Mies’s real breakthrough came in 1947 when Johnson resumed his position at the Museum of Modern Art’s Department of Architecture and Design. He had relinquished it first to attempt to found an American fascist movement, next to study architecture at Harvard, and finally to serve in the Army during the war. Back in the driver’s seat he organized a major retrospective on his friend’s work and wrote the catalogue that accompanied it. Johnson focused on the formal qualities of the new buildings at IIT, the pair of apartment towers under construction on Chicago’s Lake Shore Drive, and the house under construction for Edith Farnsworth in Plano. Their exposed steel frames, whether structural, as at IIT and in Plano, or ornamental, as in Lake Shore Drive, was fresh and exciting, having not been a feature of Mies’s work before he arrived in America. Moreover, whether or not the architect intended it, this could be—and was—understood as building upon the legacy of the expression of the skeletal steel frame in tall buildings erected in Chicago in the 1880s. Such a fusion of respect for the American roots of modern architecture with the specifically European avant-garde ambitions expressed in Mies’s unbuilt schemes of the 1920s had a strong appeal to those Cold War intellectuals anxious to demonstrate American leadership in a cultural arena. Even Farnsworth’s suit over the high cost of her house, and the support she garnered from Elizabeth Gordon, the editor of House Beautiful, remained a tempest in a teapot, as Mies’s star ascended rapidly on both sides of the Atlantic.




Unlike Gropius or Mendelsohn, Mies
was not following his arrival in America as a
shrewd networker. With Johnson and others
behind him, he did not need to be. The most
significant commission of his American career,
the Seagram Building in New York, simply fell
into his lap, when the client’s daughter Phyllis
Lambert approached the Museum of Modern
Art in 1953 for advice. Johnson was certainly
right in telling Lambert and her father Samuel
Bronfman that Mies would make something
of this opportunity in a way that even Breuer,
much less Gropius, who was among the
others they considered, could not. Sensitively
slotted into a prominent site on Park Avenue,
the elegant distillation of decades of Mies’s
thinking about skyscraper design quickly
became an American classic.

In America Mies proved able to seize
opportunities much grander than any that had
been available to him in Germany. He used
them to design buildings that, although they
arose out of his own specific concerns with the
interplay of construction and abstraction, were
capable as well to substantiate new narratives
about American artistic authority. He himself
did little actively to shape this process through
writings or other publicity. Once Johnson
had launched him, the work was powerful
enough to ensure that others did this for him.
While Gropius following his retirement from
Harvard assiduously answered every letter sent him with questions about the Bauhaus, Mies
was busy making buildings that mattered.

The United States sheltered a generation
of refugee architects, not because it was
the right thing to do but because it needed
them. Even Frank Lloyd Wright, the most
original American architect of that or any
other time, could not fuse European prestige
to responses to a decidedly American context
in a way that was likely to command the same
degree of international respect accorded the
postwar work of Breuer and Mies in particular. The challenge going forward, however, is also to discover how to make best use of the
Mendelsohns, those who have talent and
determination but belong to more marginal
social groups, and even of the Gropiuses,
who receive the warmest welcome within the
relatively narrow confines of the Academy. Not
every migrant, no matter what their profession,
will have the flexibility to begin anew in
changed circumstances, but all who succeed
will do so in part because those who are already
there recognized and nurtured their talents.

I am pursuing a career in Urban Planning and Design. 

I love this topical focus on the importance of immigrants in US architecture, and think this is a fantastic way to suggest the importance of immigrants into US culture and economy. And while I realize it can be difficult to be entirely inclusive, I'd like to point out the focus on white European male architects. 

I find it hard to believe that the only adoptive citizen architects who have influenced the US are all white, male and European. It's also important to note the influence of women, immigrant populations and the influence of the slave trade. The creation of American &amp; vernacular architecture happened through the influence of these imported populations, as well - the big names aren't the only ones who have changed our world of architecture. 

If we are looking to educate against the stereotypes that create anti-immigrant rhetoric, than we have to make sure we aren't limiting ourselves to those same stereotypes in ignoring the impact of those who don't make it into our biased history books. 



As the author, I completely agree.  I was asked to write about German emigre architects since this is my field of scholarly expertise.  But elsewhere, in Architecture since 1400 and in Modernism as Memory, I have done more of what you rightly request here.
