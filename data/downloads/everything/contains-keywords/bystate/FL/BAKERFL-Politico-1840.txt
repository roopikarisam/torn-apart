THE BUZZ: California Republicans don’t have many reasons to celebrate these days. But President Donald Trump gave them one reason for cheer Wednesday. He tweeted, “My Administration stands in solidarity with the brave citizens in Orange County defending their rights against California’s illegal and unconstitutional Sanctuary policies. California’s Sanctuary laws release known dangerous criminals into communities across the State. All citizens have the right to be protected by Federal law and strong borders.”


Story Continued Below

-- Look for Republicans to push opposition to the “sanctuary state” law hard in congressional races where multiple Republicans are trying to differentiate themselves. It’s a variation on the Democrats’ game of “who opposes Trump the most.”

-- “Trump tweets support after Orange County, California, opposes ‘sanctuary’ law,” by POLITICO’s Aubree Eliza Weaver: “During Tuesday’s meeting, Orange County Supervisor Michelle Steel told attendees that substantial changes to the United States’ immigration policies won’t happen overnight, and in the meantime ‘law enforcement should absolutely cooperate fully within the constraints of federal law.’” Story

-- “How O.C. became a center of resistance to California's 'sanctuary state' legislation,” by Cindy Carcamo, Hailey Branson-Potts and Alene Tchekmedyian: “The stance against efforts to protect people in this country illegally comes a generation after Orange County became the birthplace of Proposition 187, the divisive 1994 ballot measure meant to cut public benefits — such as schooling and healthcare — for such residents.” Story

BUENOS DÍAS, good Thursday morning. Gavin Newsom won’t debate again until May, Jerry Brown gets a new dog and Clayton Kershaw wants out of John Chiang’s latest ad.

Where’s Jerry: No public schedule.

BROWN’S NEW DOG: Tucked into Gov. Jerry Brown’s routine announcement of appointments Wednesday came news of a new gubernatorial dog. We’ll let the announcement speak for itself (read to the end for press office humor) … 

-- Cali Brown, 2 months, of Sacramento, has been appointed Deputy First Dog in the Office of Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. Born on January 26, 2018 in Herald, California, to Standard Poodle mother Bailey and Border Collie father Murphy, Cali, a Bordoodle, is without a doubt the pick of her 13-puppy litter. Cali has spent the past two months learning the ropes from a family of ranch dogs and has already shown promise in her engagement with horses, donkeys, goats, sheep and chickens. As Deputy First Dog and the newest member of the Brown family, Cali will assist First Dog Colusa Brown in herding staff at the State Capitol and will lend a paw around the family ranch in Colusa County. She will begin intensive on-the-job training with the First Dog effective immediately. This position does not require Senate confirmation — though the Deputy First Dog will gladly appear almost anywhere there are treats — and the compensation is per diem belly rubs. Cali is a Doggocrat.

-- “Meet Cali, the Golden State's new 'deputy first dog',” by LATimes’ Melanie Mason: “The job responsibilities entail helping Brown’s dog Colusa, dubbed the state’s 'First Dog' in 'herding staff at the state Capitol and lending a paw around the family ranch in Colusa County,' according to the governor’s office.” Story

NEWSOM PLAYING SAFE: Far ahead in the polls, Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom is taking a break from gubernatorial debates. He’s getting hammered for it by his opponents, but the damage is likely to be minimal (and less than the risk of a misstep on stage).

-- “Front-runner Gavin Newsom to sit out governor's race debates until May,” by LATimes’ Seema Mehta: “Gubernatorial front-runner Gavin Newsom will not participate in any more debates until early May, a spokesman for his campaign said on Wednesday.” Story

CLARK PROTESTS: "Protesters stop cars in Sacramento rush hour. Stephon Clark's body lay in open casket," by SacBee's Nashelly Chavez, Sam Stanton, Ed Fletcher and Hudson Sangree: "A protest in front of the Sacramento County District Attorney's Office late Wednesday afternoon morphed into a march that blocked traffic in downtown Sacramento during the peak of the evening commute ... There were tense moments as drivers leaving work tried to get by and protesters blocked them. Two buses were caught in the traffic jam. The demonstrators chanted 'Shut it down!' and 'Stephon Clark!' in protest of the police killing of Clark, a 22-year-old black man, in south Sacramento on March 18." Story

-- "There Are Few Police Shooting Laws In California And Major Restrictions On What Officer Info Can Go Public," by Capital Public Radio's Ben Bradford: "California has few laws on the books when it comes to how police departments respond to officer shootings. There are major restrictions on what type of police information can be made public. And measures or bills that would require the state to investigate police shootings have stalled in the Legislature in recent years." Story

QUOTE OF THE DAY: “No longer are public leaders constrained by the traditional media. Now, with social media, I can talk directly to the voters of California with no filter." -- Travis Allen, via SFChronicle's Joe Garofoli

TWEET OF THE DAY: Melanie Mason @melmason -- “Hello @GovPressOffice I would like to request the first exclusive interview with Cali, pls”

THE TRUMP ERA:

-- “Hidden Figures: How Donald Trump Is Rigging the Census,” by Ari Berman in Mother Jones: “... But with the Trump administration in charge, voting rights advocates fear the undercount could be amplified, shifting economic resources and political power toward rural, white, and Republican communities. The census is scheduled to begin on April 1, 2020, in the middle of the presidential election season. Of all the ways democracy is threatened under President Donald Trump—a blind eye to Russian meddling in elections, a rollback of voting rights, a disregard for checks and balances—an unfair and inaccurate census could have the most dramatic long-term impact.” Story

-- “What courts will be looking at in judging new census question on citizenship,” by SFChronicle’s Bob Egelko and Hamed Aleaziz: “For courts considering the Trump administration’s plan to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census, the question will be whether this is a benign inquiry designed to produce information that protects voting rights, or a politically motivated effort to depress participation in the survey — and thus congressional representation and federal funding — in immigrant-rich states like California.” Story

-- “Trump has a friend in California law enforcement,” by East Bay Express’ Darwin BondGraham: “In recent years, California's police and sheriffs' departments and district attorneys have played their own role of resistance — against a wave of progressive criminal justice and immigration reforms that state voters and political leaders have embraced. Through their rank-and-file unions and statewide lobbying groups, cops and prosecutors have fought nearly every progressive criminal justice proposal and the same California pro-immigration policies that the Trump administration hopes to topple.” Story

-- “Sheriff says ICE was ‘mistakenly’ allowed to see Santa Clara Co. inmates,” by Mercury News’ Robert Salonga: “In the wake of the policy violation, the Sheriff’s Office said jail deputies and staff were re-briefed of the sanctuary policies, which were developed with the aim of maintaining trust in immigrant communities and ensuring residents are not afraid to report crimes. Officials said fliers affirming the policies were posted in high-traffic areas for staff, inmates, and visitors to see.” Story 

-- “If China strikes back on tariffs, California tree nut exports could take a hit,” by Capital Public Radio’s Julia Mitric: “Many California farmers and wine producers see China as a growing market ... And although California’s wine producers sell a smaller proportion of their total product to China than pistachio or almond growers do, they’re frustrated by the prospect of a competitive disadvantage.” Story

-- “The citizen question: It is already being asked,” by Fox &amp; Hounds’ Tony Quinn: “Becerra and the state’s Democratic establishment are attacking the question because they assume it will keep illegal immigrants from filling out the census forms, thus California’s population will be undercounted and the state will lose federal benefits. This could be true, but will be very hard to prove.” Story

-- “ACLU asks Greyhound to adopt sanctuary policy in face of ICE interrogations,” by SFChronicle’s Sarah Ravani and Bob Egelko: “The letter was prompted by several incidents on Greyhound premises or buses in recent months, including at least two in California. In January, Border Patrol agents boarded a Greyhound bus in Indio (Riverside County) and asked every passenger for proof of citizenship, the ACLU said.” Story

CALIFORNIA AND THE CAPITOL CORRIDOR:

-- “UC schools reject March For Our Lives leader David Hogg,” by Pueng Vongs: “Hogg, originally from Los Angeles, was rejected by all four University of California schools he applied to for undergraduate admission. These included: UCLA, UCSD, UCSB and UC Irvine, reports TMZ.com.” Story

-- “Fight to resume executions in California clears 1 hurdle,” by AP’s Don Thompson: “A judge on Tuesday lifted his own court's previous order blocking California from carrying out death sentences by lethal injection, but the decision is far from the final word on the contentious issue because of several ongoing lawsuits.” Story

-- “#MeToo assemblywoman defends herself against harassment allegations, but comments spark backlash,” by Capital Public Radio’s Ben Adler: “Asm. Cristina Garcia (D-Bell Gardens) denies that she grabbed a man’s crotch — and that she forced staffers to play ‘spin the bottle’ with her. But when asked whether she referred to former Assembly Speaker John Pérez as a ‘homo,’ she acknowledged having used that word in the past — though didn’t remember if she used it about Pérez, who is gay.” Story

-- “California Legislature will 'proactively' release records on substantiated sexual harassment complaints,” by LATimes’ Melanie Mason: “The Capitol Correspondents Assn. of California reached out to legislative leaders earlier this month with concerns about inconsistencies in how the Legislature was releasing records under the Legislative Open Records Act. After releasing a decade’s worth of records on sexual harassment investigations in February, both houses offered conflicting guidance on how journalists could obtain records from recent probes.” Story 

-- “Southern California might foot the bill for delta tunnels project — with no promise of reimbursement,” by LATimes’ Bettina Boxall: “At a board workshop Tuesday, officials of the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California outlined ways in which the agency could finance the construction of two giant water tunnels under the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta.” Story

-- “A California sheriff is skirting state ‘sanctuary’ laws to help ICE capture undocumented immigrants,” by WashPost’s Alex Horton: “The move comes as California battles the federal government over how local authorities cooperate with federal immigration agencies. SB54 came into effect Jan. 1 amid intense criticism by the Trump administration over sanctuary policies that shield immigrants from increased risk of detention by ICE. On March 6, the Justice Department filed a lawsuit against the state, alleging that a trio of state laws, including SB54, violate the Constitution.” Story

CAMPAIGNS 2018 AND BEYOND:

-- “Clayton Kershaw wants out of John Chiang’s campaign ad. Chiang team says no,” by SFChronicle’s Matier &amp; Ross: “The Los Angeles Dodgers pitching ace, who will take the mound Thursday for the season opener against the Giants, pops up in a new Internet ad in which Chiang says a workplace retirement savings program he came up with has helped ‘retire more people than Clayton Kershaw’s curveball.’” Story

-- “Gun violence has defined Sen. Dianne Feinstein's political career. The issue is more important than ever for her now,” by LATimes’ Seema Mehta: “The focus on gun control comes at an opportune time for Feinstein. In her bid for a fifth full term, she is facing a challenge on her left flank. Her moderation has irked the most liberal members of her party's base, as seen in her failure to come close to obtaining the California Democratic Party's endorsement last month.” Story

-- “Commentary: Feinstein leads in Senate race but is dodging bullets from the left,” by CALmatters’ Dan Walters: “Republicans may have finally given up hope of claiming her seat, but the left-wingers, who have never liked her pragmatic approach, are incensed by her seeming unwillingness to fully embrace “the resistance” to President Donald Trump—even, at one point, suggesting that he could evolve into a good president.” Story

-- “Dumanis gave to charity, says $15,000 in donations covers tainted campaign contributions,” by Andrew Dyer for San Diego Union-Tribune: “County Board of Supervisors candidate Bonnie Dumanis has given $15,000 to a community safety fund over the past three years and is offering receipts from the charitable donations as evidence that she has unloaded any tainted money from a federal campaign-finance case.” Story

-- “Cheaper California housing? One idea to lower costs makes candidates for governor uneasy,” by SacBee’s Angela Hart: “It’s a controversial idea that advocates say could help alleviate California's worsening housing crisis: strip cities of some of their zoning authority to unleash an enormous amount of new construction.” Story

MIXTAPE:

-- “O.C. pushes homeless off the street but can't find anywhere to shelter them,” by LATimes’ Anh Do, Cindy Carcamo and Joseph Serna: Story

-- “Race to unlock San Bernardino shooter's iPhone was delayed by poor FBI communication, report finds,” by LATimes’ Joseph Tanfani: Story 

-- “Tesla shares drop as questions around fatal Model X crash in California continue to swirl,” by the Toronto Star: Story

-- “County to explore installing 'Stop the Bleed' kits for victims of mass shootings, other emergencies,” by San Diego Union-Tribune’s Lyndsay Winkley: Story 

-- “Mexico pledges $4.3 Million effort to stop tijuana spills,” by AP: Story

-- “Has California’s homeless population ‘skyrocketed’? And how does it rate nationwide?” by Politifact’s Chris Nichols: Story

CANNABIS COUNTRY:

-- “Chronic problems cast cloud over California's marijuana Mecca,” by Fortune’s Chris Morris: “The sale, says American Green, includes a provision that it continue the transformation efforts of the 80-acre town. It says it has signed a contract to develop the town for the next five to10 years.” Story

-- “California regulators target web ads for illegal pot shops,” by AP’s Michael R. Blood: “legal and illegal operators advertise next to each other, and licensed operators in California say that's put them at a disadvantage in a cutthroat marketplace.” Story

HOLLYWOODLAND:

-- “Stars of 'Veep,' 'West Wing' to lobby lawmakers ahead of White House correspondents' dinner,” by the Hill’s Judy Kurtz: “Richard Schiff, who played White House communications director Toby Ziegler on NBC’s ‘The West Wing,’ and Reid Scott, who plays a former deputy communications director on HBO’s ‘Veep,’ are some of the entertainers leading a lobbying push on Capitol Hill on the eve of the April 28 dinner.” Story

-- “Is Hollywood violence to blame for mass shootings? ‘It’s a really complex question’,” by LA Daily News’ Bob Strauss: “More scientific research indicates media violence may move some to act out the real thing, but a causal contribution of watching a ‘Game of Thrones’ bloodbath to unloading an AR-15 in class isn’t close to being proven.” Story

SILICON VALLEYLAND:’

-- “Uber puts the brakes on testing robot cars in California after Arizona fatality,” by SFChronicle’s Carolyn Said: “The move follows a March 18 crash in Tempe, Ariz., in which an Uber car operating in autonomous mode struck and killed a pedestrian. After that fatality, the ride-hailing company temporarily suspended its driverless car testing in Tempe, Pittsburgh, Toronto and San Francisco, the four cities where it operates the cars.” Story

-- “Uber to pay $10 million over claims it paid women, minority engineers less,” by Mercury News’ Ethan Baron: “The lawsuit, filed by two Latina software engineers on behalf of 420 workers, alleges that Uber paid women and minorities in certain jobs less than white or Asian men for equal work, hired them at lower-level positions than appropriate, promoted them more slowly and gave them “systematically biased” performance reviews.” Story

-- “Is it even possible to protect your privacy on Facebook?” by NPR’s Laura Sydell: “Shanna Carlile-Roy, a part time student living in a remote area of northern California, is on Facebook, but she's uncomfortable with its privacy policies. Yet she stays on the site. "I feel trapped with the site because it's such a form of connection that I've become dependent on," she says.” Story

ENDORSEMENTS -- First in Playbook -- Former Rep. Tony Coelho is endorsing Vivek Viswanathan for state treasurer … Equality California has endorsed state Assemblywoman Catharine Baker in AD-16 and dual endorsed state Assemblyman Brian Maienschein and his Democratic challenger Sunday Gover in AD-77. The group notes “these announcements represent the first time that incumbent Republican legislators have earned the group’s endorsement for reelection.”
