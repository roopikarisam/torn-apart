Every new year brings us another Sundance Film Festival and with 50 days left until Sundance 2018 kicks off on January 18th, it's time to find out what's playing this year. Sundance has revealed their 2018 selection of ALL of their official feature films in the selection this year, including 110 films playing across 9 different categories, ranging from controversial documentaries to comedies and dramas and so much more. This is the first year in a long time they have announced the full line-up in one big announcement, rather than splitting it up into a few announcements. There's some very interesting, compelling, provocative films linked to the current social/racial climate that I really can't wait to see. Dive into the entire line-up below.

Commenting on the selection this year, Robert Redford, President and Founder of Sundance Institute, said, "The work of independent storytellers can challenge and possibly change culture, illuminating our world’s imperfections and possibilities. This year's Festival is full of artfully-told stories that provoke thought, drive empathy and allow the audience to connect, in deeply personal ways, to the universal human experience." Keri Putnam, Executive Director of Sundance Institute, said, "We're proud of the diversity of this year's lineup; emboldening broader, more inclusive independent voices is a crucial part of our work at the Festival and throughout the year. These stories might inspire or move us, even occasionally make us uncomfortable – but they can shift our perspectives, spark conversation and create change." So many exciting films to see.

Sundance is one of my favorite festivals, so I'm always excited to get a glimpse at all the films playing. This year should be fun as usual. Sundance 2018 runs from January 18th to 28th, 2018. Visit Sundance.org.
