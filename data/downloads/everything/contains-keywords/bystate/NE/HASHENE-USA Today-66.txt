News: A July 18 tweet from the @USATODAY Twitter account linking to the "5 things you need to know this weekend" inadvertently paired a photo and caption that should not have been paired together. When we discovered what happened, we deleted the tweet and issued a corrected one in its place.


The image was of hooded participants in a Ku Klux Klan rally in South Carolina, and it was paired with the language, "What's going on this weekend? We've got you covered." That struck many readers as offensive, and we agree. We thought it was worth explaining what happened.


When an editor programmed the tweet to publish at 7 a.m., we didn't know that an automatic scraper from Twitter would pull in the image of the KKK rally. We didn't have a way to preview this, and the result was a tweet that we regret. In our internal content management system, we had chosen a different photo to default with that article, but this selection did not carry over to the image that Twitter automatically pulled in with the link.


USA TODAY uses tools to keep readers informed and engaged at all hours of the day. These constantly evolve, and so do we. We're taking another look at our software and practices to make sure something like this doesn't happen again.
