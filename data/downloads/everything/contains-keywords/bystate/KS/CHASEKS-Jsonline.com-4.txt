Mauston, Wis. – President Donald Trump calls the GOP tax plan a great gift to the middle class. But people in this part of “Trump Country” appear altogether underwhelmed.


“I haven’t had one person mention the tax bill to me,” said Lloyd Chase, the mayor of New Lisbon and the chairman of the Republican Party in small-town, blue-collar Juneau County, which saw the biggest vote shift in Wisconsin last fall from Obama to Trump.


Many voters say they’ve paid little attention to the bill, which Congress is expected to pass this week. Others say its swift and twisting path toward passage has left them in the dark about its final shape and impact, fueling their skepticism about its benefits.


“We have no clue,” said Christopher Swan, part of a group of men in their 60s, 70s, and 80s who meet every weekday morning for coffee at Randall’s Uptown tavern in Mauston.  


His assumption?


“We’re not going to feel any (tax) relief and, if anything, it will get a little worse,” he said.


In dozens of interviews last week, there was more puzzlement, wariness or cynicism toward the tax bill than ardent support or opposition.  The plan has polled poorly in national surveys.

“I’m really tuning it out.  It’s a little bit too much politics for me right now.  Taxes are important to me, but I get tired of the ‘what ifs.’ … You hear four tax brackets, then you hear five, then you hear six, then you hear seven,” said Dan Kattenbraker, a physician who was interviewed at Mauston High School after a victory by the boys basketball team. 


“I just don’t hear any kind of resounding or clarion call for getting this tax bill through,” said former GOP Gov. Tommy Thompson, who grew up in Juneau County and owns a farm there. “I don’t think (people) understand it. I don’t think they think there’s going to be anything in it for them. … A business tax cut from 39 to 22 (percent) doesn’t mean jack to them.”

Based on conversations with voters, a combination of factors help explain the failure of the tax bill to generate much excitement or enthusiasm in this small (about 26,000 people), economically challenged county in central Wisconsin.


There’s hostility to what some voters see as a boon to the wealthy.


There’s the fact that the issue of taxes generates a good deal less interest — and heat — than health care, the subject of the last big legislative push in Congress.  


There’s the confusion that comes with a fast-moving, shape-shifting rewrite of a massive tax code. Many voters questioned whether lawmakers had read or fully understood the massive bill they are about to pass.

And there’s widespread political distrust — distrust among Democrats of Trump and the GOP, distrust among many independents and conservatives in Congress and the political class.

Chase, GOP county chair and owner of an auto parts store, blames the bill’s flat reception in part on negative media coverage he regards as unfair to the bill.  But he also points to other reasons.


“I guess maybe people have heard talk like that before (of big tax cuts) and haven’t really seen it affect them directly. Maybe it’s too complicated for people to want to even try to understand it,” he said.


He and others suggest that an uptick in the economy may have reduced the potency of taxes as an issue.


“Nobody is running around calling for a tax cut,” said Jim Ryczek, a Democrat who was interviewed before a holiday concert by the Mauston High School Cheese Head Band. “I do wish they would simplify (the tax code), but there is nothing simple about this (plan).”

Juneau County has an older population and one of the lowest shares of people with four-year degrees in Wisconsin. It ranks below average (but not rock bottom) in a broad mix of economic indicators. Two of the biggest employers are the state detention centers that have opened since 2000: the New Lisbon Correctional Institution and Sand Ridge Secure Treatment Center in Mauston, a facility for sex offenders. 


The county has voted for every presidential winner since 1964. Trump won Juneau last November by 26 points. Obama won it by 7 in 2012. That 33-point shift was the biggest among Wisconsin’s 72 counties, and one of the 10 biggest swings in the nation.  


Thompson, the former governor from Elroy, calls it a “hard county” economically, suggesting that reality and the area’s conservative, blue-collar and independent strains were tailor-made for Trump. (Juneau was one of two Wisconsin counties that voted libertarian for governor in 2002 when Thompson’s brother Ed occupied that line on the ballot).  


But some of the same forces that contributed to Trump’s victory here feed the skepticism over the tax bill — a sense that working people are getting shafted, a jaded view of Washington, and deep skepticism toward Congress. 


The morning coffee gang at Randall’s Uptown in Mauston is a case in point. Sitting around a table under a mounted buck’s head, a Miller Lite lamp, a Brett Favre poster and a Wisconsin Badgers scoreboard, they open the tavern at 6 a.m. Monday through Friday. Their sessions are a friendly, wide-ranging free-for-all.  Whether the Packers should fire Coach Mike McCarthy is a hot topic. Several voted for Trump, but their politics are mixed.


One member of the group, banker Paul Schaller, was mostly happy with the tax plan, saying it will save business people he knows sizable sums that he believes will be re-invested in their companies.    


“I am very excited for the economy. I just want to make sure there’s benefits all the way down (the income ladder) and that’s hard to measure,” he said.


Others were much more doubtful.


“Initially it’s a little break (for people), but then in the next couple of years it goes up,” said Larry Purvis.


“Most people at our level, here at the streets, folks in small communities, I think we feel somewhat hopeless at times … because of how far removed (from us) all these rules get made,” said Swan, who cited the bill’s impact on the deficit, estimated at more than $1 trillion over 10 years.  


“Why do they even keep track of it if you can’t fix it?”  he said. “I’m worried about my children and my grandkids — what kind of situation are we leaving them?”


Even some business people here who stand to benefit from the plan were muted in their support, either because of their uncertainty over the bill’s details or their general lack of confidence in Congress.  


“A big improvement? That sounds like a heavy lift for this legislation and for this Congress,” said Jeff Scully. “I don’t think anybody is looking for the magic wand that’s going to change everything. But give me a little bit.” 


GOP leaders in Congress are hoping the tax cuts poll better once people have a chance to digest the plan in its final form and once the changes take effect and people begin to see savings. They are also hoping an improving economy provides a political boost.  


But Thompson, the longtime politician now in the private sector, said he doesn’t think a legislative “win” on taxes is enough to boost congressional Republicans nationally in an anti-Washington environment.  


“When the Congress failed to get a health care bill quickly, I think people just got turned off and said, ‘Congress is still broke,’ and this doesn’t change that,” he said. “I think the Republicans are going to have one helluva tough election.”
