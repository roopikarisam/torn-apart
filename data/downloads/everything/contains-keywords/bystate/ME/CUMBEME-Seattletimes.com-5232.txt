BANGOR, Maine (AP) — Maine Gov. Paul LePage is threatening to remove sheriffs from office who refuse to detain immigrants for federal immigration officials.

Maine’s constitution appears to give the governor some authority in removing elected sheriffs.

The Bangor Daily News reports the Republican governor made the comments to conservative radio host Laura Ingraham on Monday. He didn’t name sheriffs he would target.

Cumberland County Sheriff Kevin Joyce has said he would reject requests by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials to hold prisoners in jail beyond their scheduled release.

Joyce said county commissioners would have to begin the removal process, starting with impeachment proceedings.

County Commissioner James Cloutier says he’s certain his fellow commissioners would not remove Joyce.

LePage spokeswoman Julie Rabinowitz says the governor has not taken any action to remove a sheriff.

This story has been corrected to show Cloutier said he’s certain fellow commissioners would not be interested in removing Joyce, not that they would be.
