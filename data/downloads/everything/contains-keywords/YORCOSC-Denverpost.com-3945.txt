The ACLU of Colorado is asking U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for more information and records relating to the in-custody death of an Iranian man at the private Aurora detention facility.

Kamyar Samimi, 64, was arrested by ICE agents in Denver on Nov. 17 — more than 12 years after he was convicted of cocaine possession in Arapahoe County.

ICE said Samimi “fell ill” on Dec. 2 and although emergency responders came to the GEO Group-operated detention center and started performing CPR, Samimi later died at an area hospital.

ICE said at the time his preliminary cause of death was cardiac arrest.

According to ICE, Samimi first entered the U.S. in New York in April 1976 as a student, and became a permanent resident in May 1979. But in January 1987, ICE says, his application for full citizenship was denied because he didn’t submit the correct documents.
