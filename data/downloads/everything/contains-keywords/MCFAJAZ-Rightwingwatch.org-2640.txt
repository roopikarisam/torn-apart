In an interview with “Breitbart News Daily” last week, Arizona U.S. Senate candidate Joe Arpaio suggested taking the infamous tent city he ran as sheriff of Maricopa County, Arizona, to house immigrants at the southern border of the U.S.

Arpaio’s tent city jail, which he once referred to as a “concentration camp,” gained national infamy for its harsh conditions for inmates.

The host of the Breitbart show read a question from a listener, who asked Arpaio if the tent city was “something you could implement at a broader level, at a national level perhaps.”

“Yeah, great question,” Arpaio said. “I started that with Korean War tents right after I took office, 24 years. It’s hot here in Maricopa County. Over half a million had come through the tent city, so why not put the tents up at the border, save some money, nothing wrong with that, so I’m going to pursue that too. As a U.S. senator I’ll have more authority than I do as the Maricopa County sheriff, so I’m going to use that authority and do what I feel is right.”
