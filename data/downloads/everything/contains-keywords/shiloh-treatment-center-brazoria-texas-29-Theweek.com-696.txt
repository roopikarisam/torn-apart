A visibly distraught Rachel Maddow ended her show after trying to report on shelters housing babies forcibly separated from immigrant parents

MSNBC's Rachel Maddow broke down in tears Tuesday night while trying to make her way through an Associated Press report about "tender age" shelters, which are being used by the Trump administration to house babies and toddlers forcibly separated from their parents on the U.S.-Mexico border.

Maddow, visibly distraught, was unable to make her way through the opening sentence of the report, looking up at the camera to say, "I think I'm going to have to hand this off. Sorry, that's it for us tonight, we'll see you again tomorrow."

She later tweeted an apology to her viewers:




Ugh, I'm sorry. If nothing else, it is my job to actually be able to speak while I'm on TV.What I was trying to do -- when I suddenly couldn't say/do anything -- was read this lede:1/6

Maddow subsequently shared the AP report, which reads: "Trump administration officials have been sending babies and other young children forcibly separated from their parents to at least three 'tender age' shelters in South Texas. Lawyers and medical providers who have visited the 'tender age' shelters described play rooms of crying preschool-age children in crisis." Maddow added: "Again, I apologize for losing it there for a moment. Not the way I intended that to go, not by a mile."

Her fans were understanding. "Rachel Maddow breaking down on live TV is all of us," tweeted writer Brian Tyler Cohen. Jeva Lange

Fox News will be featured in Facebook's news coverage twice as much as any other outlet

Fox News claims it features "Real News" and "Real Honest Opinion," and it seems Facebook now agrees.

After years of accusations that Facebook's algorithm is programmed to favor left-leaning news coverage, CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced a plan to improve the quality and balance of the news in users' feeds. If the new lineup of Facebook's news briefing segments is any indication, that quality and balance is now tipping in favor of Fox News, Variety reported Wednesday.

Starting on July 16, ABC News, Mic, CNN, Bloomberg, and others will be featured in a dedicated news section on the social media site. But as The Verge pointed out, the schedule looks heavy on the Fox News coverage, while light on many others. Fox News will air in the morning and in the afternoon, with shows seven days a week. CNN, in comparison, will air segments led by Anderson Cooper five days a week, in the evenings only.

Eagle-eyed conservatives have been calling on Facebook to better highlight a wider array of ideologies, claiming that the platform was purposefully suppressing right-leaning news outlets. Whether Facebook is trying to make up for lost coverage or believes this schedule is the best way to provide "trustworthy, informative, and local" news, conservative news junkies can call this a win.

Ancient humans migrated out of Africa 'way earlier' than scientists ever imagined

Our ancestors may have lived on continents other than Africa much earlier than scientists previously thought.

Archaeologists recently excavated stone tools in Shangchen, China, that were made about 2.12 million years ago, LiveScience reported Wednesday. While the common theory is that hominins didn't leave Africa until about 1.8 million years ago, the finding would suggest that they were in fact on the move much earlier.

"It suggests a way earlier migration out of Africa than we ever would have imagined," Michael Petraglia, a paleoanthropologist at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Human History, told LiveScience.

The researchers, from China and the U.K., found quartz stones that nearly look like naturally produced sediment formations. But upon closer inspection, the stones flaked in such a way that suggests they were shaped by human hands. Scientists are still working to determine exactly how old the artifacts are, and to verify that they really are evidence of a human presence in ancient China.

Homo erectus, or even some earlier species of hominin, had to have migrated out of Africa roughly 10,000 generations earlier than scientists thought, the finding suggests. "It really opens all sorts of questions with respect to migrations out of Africa and the ability of these humans to adapt to various ecological circumstances," said Petraglia.

These immigration courts can crank out a deportation verdict in 30 seconds

When former President George W. Bush's administration saw a spike in arrests at America's southern border, he spearheaded Operation Streamline and opened a handful of fast-paced courts to clear a backlog of immigration trials.

The program still exists today, and can crank out eight deportation verdicts in as little as four minutes. That's about one verdict every 30 seconds — a rapid-fire pace that lawyers, and even one judge, say is probably too fast for defendants to understand, BuzzFeed News reports.

Operation Streamline kicked off in 2005 with a few courts in Texas. It's since expanded to New Mexico, Arizona, and, just this week, California. Under the program, migrants are given public attorneys who are often juggling multiple cases in a day, BuzzFeed News says. The defendants get 20 to 40 minutes with a lawyer before they're shuffled into a courtroom with a handful of other migrants, where they're given headsets that translate English proceedings to Spanish — even if that's not their native language.

Attorneys and activists say the system results in most migrants pleading guilty and being deported, likely without a clue what's happening. Lawyers who spoke to BuzzFeed News acknowledge how problematic this can seem — and so did one immigration judge. "I am aware that a person could probably make it through the proceedings without a thorough understanding of their rights and the court proceedings," U.S. District Court Judge Leslie Bowman said during one case.

But some defense attorneys say the quick pace is actually better than proceedings before Operation Streamline. Under the previous process, migrants often waited in detention for weeks or months before getting a trial; now, they're detained for less than 72 hours and sent on the first bus home.

There's bipartisan agreement that Trump's Germany comments were a big mistake

Former Secretary of State John Kerry hasn't held his tongue when it comes to criticizing President Trump. Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah) has kept quiet, if he has criticism at all.

But both of these political veterans had sharp words for the president after he said that Germany is "totally controlled by Russia" at a Wednesday breakfast meeting during this week's NATO summit in Brussels. When asked if he agreed that Germany is "captive to Russia," as Trump said Wednesday, Hatch told reporters that the president "can be a little too critical of the other [NATO] counterparts, and I don't think he should be critical." Hatch added that he has met German Chancellor Angela Merkel and has "the highest opinion of her," Politico reports.

Kerry, who served as America's chief diplomat under former President Barack Obama, opted to completely tear Trump apart in a statement he shared on Twitter. In it, Kerry savages Trump's remarks as "strange," "counterproductive," "disgraceful," and "destructive," among a slew of other insults. "The president set America back this morning," Kerry wrote. "He is steadily destroying our reputation in the word." Read his full statement below. Kathryn Krawczyk

Pink is the world's oldest color

Earth may be known as the Blue Planet now, but evidence suggests that back in the day, it was probably pink.

Scientists have discovered the earliest evidence for a color appearing in nature: "bright pink pigments" that exist in an ancient kind of chlorophyll, said Dr. Nur Gueneli, a researcher with the Australian National University. Discovered inside rocks found under the Sahara Desert in West Africa, these pigments are believed to be over 1.1 billion years old, Interesting Engineering reported.

While the chlorophyll we learn about in science classes today is green, this prehistoric version was used by marine bacteria that cast a "brilliant pink" color over the ocean all those years ago, Live Science explained. That hue wouldn't be overtaken by greener algae for hundreds of millions of years.

That algae eventually turned into the basis for the wide variety of life that led to the evolution of large animals, including humans. But a billion years ago, "the planet belonged to the bacteria," Live Science reported.

Archaeologists discover mysterious black sarcophagus that miraculously hasn't been opened in 2,000 years

Archaeologists have discovered an enormous black granite sarcophagus in Egypt, with the million-dollar question being: Who's in the box? The largest sarcophagus to ever be found in the city of Alexandria, Egypt, at almost 9 feet long and 5 feet wide, the ominous black tomb likely belonged to someone of standing, Science Alert reports.

Two more details make the find even more mysterious. The first is the large, roughly-sculpted white alabaster head found in the ground with the sarcophagus — presumably a bust of whoever is inside. Then there is the layer of mortar between the lid of the sarcophagus and the rest of the tomb, indicating that it hasn't been opened in the 2,000 years since it was sealed. That's particularly rare for Egypt, where looters have been rampant for millennia, Smithsonian reports.

The burial dates back to the era of Ptolemies, between 305 and 30 B.C. While scientists have yet to open the sarcophagus, this much is certain: Even more secrets must lie inside. Jeva Lange

Paul Manafort is secretly sending emails from his jail cell

Don't cry for Paul Manafort — his nearly 24-hour jailing in solitary confinement is of the VIP variety.

President Trump's former campaign manager has been sending emails, making hundreds of calls on a personal telephone, and bathing in a private bathroom, a Wednesday filing from Special Counsel Robert Mueller showed.

MSNBC's Rachel Maddow pointed out that the documents paint a pretty rosy picture of Manafort's confinement, all things considered. "Among the unique privileges Manafort enjoys at the jail are a private, self-contained living unit, which is larger than the other inmates' units, his own bathroom and shower facility, his own personal telephone, and his own workspace to prepare for trial," the special counsel's office wrote. "Manafort is also not required to wear a prison uniform. On the monitored prison phone calls, Manafort has mentioned that he is being treated like a 'VIP.'"

Inmates are not supposed to send emails, but Mueller's office says that Manafort "appears to have developed a workaround." When his team visits the facility, they bring a laptop, which Manafort uses to read and compose emails. After his team leaves, the laptop connects to the internet and sends whatever Manafort typed out.

Manafort was sent to jail last month after he was accused of witness tampering following his charges of conspiracy and money laundering. He was previously under house arrest while awaiting trial, but it sounds like prison isn't cramping his style too badly. Summer Meza
