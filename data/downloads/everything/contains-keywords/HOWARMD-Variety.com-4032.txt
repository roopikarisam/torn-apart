Brace yourself. In a break from previous years, when the lineup was divided up and revealed section by section over several days, the Sundance Film Festival has unveiled its entire feature program in a single announcement, touting 110 films — 99 of them world premieres — set to screen in Park City next month, where the festival will unspool from Jan. 18-28.

While that may sound like a lot of a movies, it’s actually a few smaller than the previous edition, which included 118 features, just as the pool of submissions shrunk slightly (to 3,901, down 4% from 4,068 a year earlier), although the difference will be more than compensated for by the addition of a new “Indie Episodic” TV section, to be announced next Monday.

In the meantime, there’s plenty to digest among the features, which cover a wide range of genres and styles, while demonstrating conversation-setting engagement with a number of contemporary themes, from police brutality (day one premiere “Blindspotting,” multi-perspective “Monsters and Men”) to sexual abuse (pedophilia survivor’s story “The Tale,” homosexual conversion therapy memoir “The Miseducation of Cameron Post”).

	


“One of the things we observed this year was the ongoing awareness — by audiences and the industry and the press — of the need for alternative voices and points of view in this medium,” observed festival director John Cooper. “That has long been a hallmark of independent film, but it’s really the increase in the number of personal stories [from those who didn’t have a voice before] that we’ve noticed the most over the last couple of years as we program the festival.”

This year’s edition includes films from 47 first-time directors, representing 29 countries, including two debuts from actors-turned-directors: Paul Dano’s “Wildlife” and Idris Elba’s “Yardie,” both adapted from novels, and Rupert Everett’s Oscar Wilde biopic “The Happy Prince” (not counting Ethan Hawke, whose third narrative feature, “Blaze,” is the actor-director’s first to debut at Sundance). But even Hawke isn’t the most experienced helmer in U.S. dramatic competition. That honor goes to Chile’s Sebastián Silva, whose “Tyrel” marks his sixth film to play Sundance.

Meanwhile, starrier films by veteran helmers land in the Premieres section, where the Zellner brothers offer their eccentric spin on the Western (starring Robert Pattinson and Mia Wasikowska), Claire McCarthy offers an alternate perspective on the Hamlet story in “Ophelia” (with Daisy Ridley in the title role), and Wash Westmoreland directs his first film following the death of life partner Richard Glatzer with “Colette” (featuring Keira Knightley as the novelist forced to publish under her husband’s name).

According to Cooper and Sundance director of programming Trevor Groth, such films offer especially rich roles for their leading ladies — a trend they observed across the selection, citing Maggie Gyllenhaal’s star turn in “The Kindergarten Teacher” (an English-language remake of the Israeli film) and Kiwi newcomer Thomasin Harcourt McKenzie, the latest discovery of Debra Granik (who effectively launched Jennifer Lawrence’s career with “Winter’s Bone” eight years earlier at Sundance).

	


Among major international festivals, Sundance has long featured one of the most balanced lineups in terms of films directed by and starring women, though in light of recent revelations about sexual harassment in the independent film world (from the Harvey Weinstein bombshell to last year’s Casey Affleck controversy), Cooper and Sundance director of programming Trevor Groth are looking forward to the positive conversations on the subject at this year’s festival.

“I think the artists and the storytellers and the filmmakers have always been responsive and out in front of the issues facing our times and trying to engage with them,” Groth says. “Then, depending on what’s happening in the world and the zeitgeist, it’s the audience’s reaction to those issues that shifts. We felt that last year with Trump. We’re feeling it this year with a lot of the women’s issues, such as sexual assault.”

Strong women also play a prominent role on the documentary side, which will see the launch of new films about actress-cum-activist Jane Fonda, power attorney Gloria Allred, justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, pop icon Joan Jett, and British rapper M.I.A.

According to Cooper, it typically takes filmmakers about two years to react to current events, making it still a bit early for commentaries on the Trump presidency, whereas audiences can expect to see other movements addressed in diverse and provocative ways at this year’s festival. “I think Black Lives Matter had a real effect on us all, and you see many more films about the African-American experience in America, especially the male experience,” he says.

Likewise, the 2018 lineup features an unusually strong representation of LGBT characters — “The Catcher Was the Spy,” “The Happy Prince,” “Hearts Beat Loud,” “Skate Kitchen,” “White Rabbit” and Gus Van Sant’s “Don’t Worry, He Won’t Get Far On Foot” — and even one film, “A Kid Like Jake,” from a trans director, Silas Howard.

	


The upcoming festival features a new screening venue, between the Holiday Village and the Yarrow (now called “Park Ave.”), where the Sports Authority store used to be. Sundance will use the basement of this new space to host most of its virtual reality program.

Sundance is also adding two new awards. The first, to be known as the “Festival Favorite award, will identify the single film from any category that most connects with audiences, to be announced after the festival. Also new is the “NEXT Innovator” prize, to be selected by a single luminary (this year’s award-giver soon to be revealed) to that person’s favorite film in the NEXT category.
