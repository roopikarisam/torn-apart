An Elgin man was sentenced to seven years in prison Monday after pleading guilty to sexually abusing an underage girl while he serving as a youth minister at a West Dundee church, according to the Kane County State's Attorney's Office.


Chad A. Coe, 36, of the 500 block of Dundee Avenue, pleaded guilty to felony aggravated criminal sexual abuse just before his trial was to begin, a news release from the state's attorney's office said. He was sentenced by Kane County Circuit Judge James Hallock.


Coe admitted to having sexual contact with the girl in June 2013 at the church, located in the 900 block of South Eighth St., knowing she was under the age of 18, the release said.


In addition to the prison term, Coe must also register as a sex offender for the rest of his life.


The Kane County Child Advocacy Center investigated the case with assistance from the West Dundee Police Department and the Kane County Major Crimes Task Force, the release said.


"Not only was this victim abused by a person she thought she could trust, she persevered against him despite his attempts to minimize his criminal conduct by villainizing her and engaging in victim blaming," State's Attorney Joe McMahon said in a statement. "This case should be a reminder to the community that the vast majority of child sex crimes are committed by people who know their victims and seek to exploit those relationships."
