From 5 p.m. to 1 a.m. on Saturday July 14,2018  the Cheatham County Sheriff’s Office (CCSO) will conduct a sobriety checkpoint and saturation patrol in the area of Highway 12 South between Walmart and the Davidson County line to crack down on impaired driving in Cheatham County.


As noncompliance with the safety belt and child restraint laws place people in danger, these laws will be vigorously enforced as well.

"The Sheriff’s Office recognizes that roadside sobriety checkpoints are highly visible and effective tools in the battle against impaired driving,” said Sheriff Mike Breedlove. “In the event of inclement weather, the initiative will be rescheduled for a later date.”
