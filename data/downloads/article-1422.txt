Growing up in Texas, Case Keenum went against the grain and had a John Elway poster hanging in his bedroom. The image is of Elway, donning his all-blue Broncos uniform and in position to throw. Timestamps in the background count down from two minutes to the last second and the words “it’s never over” are stamped across the front. 






Elway, the king of the fourth-quarter comebacks, was the childhood idol of the player who recently pulled off one of the game’s most thrilling finales in playoff history, as quarterback of the Minnesota Vikings last season. 

“That’s why I always wore No. 7,” Keenum said. “As a kid growing up, a coach’s kid, wanting to play quarterback. It was Elway and the Broncos and (Troy) Aikman and the Cowboys. That was a big part of my childhood.” 

Keenum’s childhood dream became reality when he signed a two-year, $36 million contract with the Broncos and, on Friday, was introduced by Elway as Denver’s next starting quarterback. Keenum won’t get to don his No. 7 — Elway will hold onto that — but No. 4 will do just fine. 

“Just getting introduced by John Elway as the Denver Broncos‘ quarterback,” he said, “that is a dream come true. … I’m excited to get in the locker room. I’m excited to earn the right to be a leader. I’m excited to be the quarterback of the Denver Broncos.”

In the months leading up to free agency, the league’s focus was primarily on one guy who most believed would dictate the market for quarterbacks behind him. Kirk Cousins was on the move and as a 28-year-old, injury-free quarterback, he was bound to be chased by numerous suitors. 

The Broncos set their sights elsewhere though, thanks in part to the intel received from coach Vance Joseph and senior personnel advisor Gary Kubiak. The two worked with Keenum in Houston when he was signed as an undrafted free agent in 2012, and they knew the player he was, the guy he was and the quarterback he could be for the Broncos. 


“We talked about after the season that we needed to upgrade at that position and we got our guy. We got the guy that was our target,” Elway said. “Having gone through the whole process in the offseason, with where we are until today, everything that we looked at, it all came out to Case.” 

Keenum did the same on his end. When the Vikings’ playoff run ended at the hands of the Philadelphia Eagles in January, he and his agents began to examine his next potential landing spots. 

“The fact that I was their guy from the start. We didn’t wait around,” he said. “We made it happen. Denver was No. 1 on my list, too. It’s been an incredible welcome here.” 

Monday evening, the sides reached an agreement on a two-year deal that is player- and team-friendly but left open a chance for questions about the Broncos’ quarterback conundrum. The team has rotated through three different starters over the past two seasons, and landing Keenum on a shorter-team deal raised the possibility of more turnover for a franchise that needs stability. 

“For myself and my agents, first of all, we want to be here long-term,” Keenum said. “My wife and I love it already. We want to play the rest of my career here. There’s no doubt about that. I think the two years is an opportunity to continue to prove myself as a starting quarterback, as a franchise quarterback, as somebody a team can count on. I think that made the most sense for my agents and I and the deal they put together, it was great.” 

The road here, however, was unlikely and winding and often trying. Keenum was largely unrecruited coming out of Wylie High School in Abilene, Texas. He received only one scholarship offer, from the University of Houston, and when the 2012 draft rolled around, he never heard his name. 

The Texans, then coached by Kubiak, signed Keenum and later added him to their practice squad before he was called up to start in place of the injured Matt Schaub in 2013. Keenum’s first eight NFL games were a string of losses that included the firing of Kubiak. 

After bouncing between the Texans and Rams over the years, landing backup and starting roles, Keenum signed a one-year deal with Minnesota last offseason. When Sam Bradford went down with an injury, Keenum took over and guided the Vikings to an 11-3 record as a starter, led them to the NFC championship game and played a starring role in the Minnesota Miracle — a 61-yard touchdown pass to Stefon Diggs as the clock expired in a divisional playoff win over New Orleans. 

That game, that play, that moment under pressure painted the picture of a quarterback much different from the one that started his career in the NFL six years earlier. The 2017 season — when he ranked second in completion percentage (67.6 percent) and ranked among the league’s top 10 in multiple other passing categories — also solidified what the Broncos had suspected: the guy has it, and he was the right guy for the Broncos. 

“There’s a special fit for everybody,” Elway said. “Obviously, all the other quarterbacks that were available are good players, but we thought that the year Case had last year but also what he’s been through, where he’s been and his mentality and plus having V.J. know him and Gary know him … plus the year he had last year. It’s very arguable whether, even though Kirk got a lot of the (attention), who had the best year? 

“He’s won a lot of football games, so when we all came to it, Case was the guy that we wanted.”
