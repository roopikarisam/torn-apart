Good morning.

Today’s introduction comes from Adam Nagourney, the Los Angeles bureau chief.


It’s not so easy living up in the Hollywood Hills these days. First it was the onslaught of tourists on foot, clogging the narrow, twisting streets as they used GPS devices in search of the Hollywood sign. These days, it’s a louder and more cumbersome intruder: open-air tour vans, pushing through on roads that can barely fit one car, some with loudspeakers blaring dubious claims by the driver. (“And on the left, the house where Humphrey Bogart once lived!”)


Confronted with the anguished concerns of neighbors, the Los Angeles City Council is trying to walk a fine line by responding to upset constituents without hurting tourism, a major economic force here. (And there are few tourist draws as big as the Hollywood sign.) The council is moving to adopt regulations that would require tour operators to give patrons private headphones, getting rid of squawky speakers. And the city is drawing up a list of streets where tour vans would be banned completely.


“You’re talking about over 100 buses every day traveling the small streets of Hollywood Hills,” said Anastasia Mann, the president of the Hollywood Hills West Neighborhood Council. “Blocking Mulholland Drive and creating huge hazards. It really gets out of hand.”

Neighborhood groups in Hollywood are often criticized for being resistant to development and outsiders. But the roads in the hills can be extraordinarily narrow, and it is not unusual to come around a blind corner to confront an oncoming tour van.


“This is not a Nimby issue,” said David Ryu, a City Council member who represents the neighborhood, using the acronym for “Not In My Back Yard.”


“It’s been a plague on their neighborhood,” Mr. Ryu said. “This is about making sure the promotion of tourism is done in a safe manner. I see it as a way to crack down on the bad operator while making sure it’s safe and fun for all.”

On a foggy morning exactly 10 years ago, a container ship struck one of the Bay Bridge towers, unleashing a swath of oil that would contaminate the environment. The spill, caused by the Cosco Busan, was not the largest in Bay Area history — when two tankers collided there in 1971, they spilled more than 10 times as much bunker oil — but the numbers were striking.


44,400,000The shipping companies that owned and operated the Cosco Busan reached a $44.4 million settlement to reimburse government agencies that responded to the spill; as restitution for the lost human uses of the shoreline; and to restore damaged fish and bird habitats.


53,000The Cosco Busan sent about 53,000 gallons of bunker oil into the bay. By comparison, the Exxon Valdez spilled about 11 million gallons into Alaska’s Prince William Sound in 1989, and the Deepwater Horizon explosion released more than 160 million gallons into the Gulf of Mexico in 2010.


6,849An estimated 6,849 birds died from the oil spill, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association. Birds from 65 species, including the threatened marbled murrelet and snowy plover, were killed.


100The crash left a 100-foot gash on the port side of the 926-foot ship, which was traveling at 11 knots, or 12.7 miles per hour, when it hit the bridge.


10The Cosco Busan’s pilot, John J. Cota, was sentenced to 10 months in federal prison after pleading guilty to violating the Clean Water Act and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. According to his lawyers, he had piloted about 4,000 ships in a 27-year career before the crash — with only one minor accident.
