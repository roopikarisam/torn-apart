Fire Sweeps Into Ventura

Driven by wind gusts of 50 mph, a fire that broke out in the foothills near Thomas Aquinas College in Santa Paula swept into the city of Ventura early Tuesday, burning homes and forcing evacuations. The extent of the destruction was unclear; one person was reported killed in a traffic accident on a road closed because of the fire. Forecasters had issued a red flag warning in Ventura and L.A. counties through Thursday because of dry conditions and fierce Santa Ana winds.

Trump Brings Down These Two Monuments

Two million acres. That’s how much President Trump carved out of the 1.35-million-acre Bears Ears and 1.9-million-acre Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments in southern Utah, couching the move as a return of the land to local control and out of the hands of “distant bureaucrats.” “You know how best to take care of your land,” the president told a crowd in Salt Lake City. Though polls say Utah residents are divided on the issue, state lawmakers had lobbied for the change, which improves access to coal, oil, natural gas and uranium. Next step: Will it hold up in court?

Travel Ban 3.0 Is in Force, for Now

Speaking of legal challenges.… The Supreme Court ruled that Trump may put the third version of his travel ban into effect while cases challenging it make their way through lower courts. The decision, with only two dissents, suggests the justices believe it does not exceed the president’s powers. The U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals and the 9th Circuit are scheduled to hear arguments this week.

An Assemblyman Is Accused

Dababneh has strongly denied the allegation. “I am utterly shocked and blown away,” said the assemblyman, whose district includes Encino, Tarzana and Woodland Hills. “This is a career-ending charge based on no facts.”

Less Ice in the Arctic = More Drought in California

What does rapidly melting Arctic sea ice have to do with drought in California? A lot, according to new research. The model that scientists at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory used looks at the link between the disappearing sea ice and the buildup of high ridges of atmospheric pressure over the Pacific Ocean, which push winter storms away from the state. They say it could reduce precipitation over California by as much as 15% within two to three decades.
