On the first of Brovember, the Broncos named Brock Osweiler their starting quarterback. 

Cool, dude. 

Osweiler will never be as handsome as Tom Brady or as cerebral as Peyton Manning. But know why this change at quarterback, while it smacks of desperation from a team that has not only lost three straight games but also its identity, just might work? 

Osweiler is one righteous bro. The Brock Lobster speaks wisdom that fits neatly on a T-shirt, stuff like: “Ball security is job security.” This is a quarterback who won’t fumble the pizza box, even when blindsided by trouble in a parking lot at 2 a.m. Heck, the Cleveland Browns are paying Osweiler $15 million to strap on his helmet in Denver and take snaps for a team that still has a shot at the playoffs. 

Beats working, brovocado. 

The Broncos don’t need Osweiler to be Superman. In fact, coach Vance Joseph has basically informed the new starting QB that he has just one job. As Osweiler volunteered: “I’m being told, ‘Protect the football.’ ” 

Despite a daunting schedule the remainder of this month, the switch from struggling Trevor Siemian to Osweiler might hit the reset button for the reeling Broncos. All Osweiler needs to do is play like the same Bro Montana that came off the bench for a Denver team stuck in crisis mode two years ago, instead of pretending to be a quarterback he is not. That’s a mistake Oz made when he went to Houston last season, then tried way too hard to justify the big bucks the Texans overpaid for his services. 

In 15 regular-season games of his life that Osweiler will never get back, he compiled a miserable 72.2 quarterback rating with the Texans, playing even worse than the 76.8 rating that has sent Siemian to the Denver bench. From afar, it appeared to me as if Osweiler made playing QB in the NFL a bigger job than it already is. A bro tried to be the man. It was a mess. 


“Maybe in that situation I was trying to do too much. I think, like smart players would, you would learn from that and you’re not going to replicate that,” said Osweiler, looking me squarely in the eye. “That’s a great observation on your behalf, but I’m moving forward.” 

One foot in front of the other, he has climbed from a dark hole that could have swallowed a weaker man’s career. In 2017 alone, Osweiler has gone from winning a playoff game with Houston … to being declared persona non grata with the Texans … to being shipped off to the NFL’s version of Siberia in trade … to being cut by Browns management, which doesn’t know how to operate a football franchise or a fax machine. 

Hey, we couldn’t make this stuff up.

“Brock is the quarterback right now,” Joseph said. “After this week, we’ll figure out the next week.” 

On Nov. 22, 2015, Osweiler got his first NFL start, replacing the injured Manning, and on his first possession in Chicago, he threw a short pass to Demaryius Thomas, who rambled 48 yards for a touchdown that ignited a spark. 

It was a beautiful bromance. Until it wasn’t. After leading the Broncos to a four victories in a span of six weeks, including a 30-24 overtime win against Handsome Tom and the previously undefeated Patriots, Osweiler was benched in the last game of the regular season for Manning. Oz was ticked when told to stand down. I never understood why Broncos Country got so mad at his reaction. Any righteous dude would have been upset, because all any bro wants is a chance to play. 

While there might be some fans who still hold a grudge against Osweiler for skipping the trip to the White House with the Broncos to celebrate their Super Bowl 50 victory, he was greeted with hugs in the locker room when returning to town this year. And, believe me, players view personnel changes in the huddle as no big deal, because everybody eventually becomes a replaceable part in this league.  “My quarterback is like my wife, so I don’t really care who’s back there. I’m going to protect like it is,” offensive tackle Garett Bolles said. “I love Brock …” 

The No. 17 the Broncos have known and would love again is a quarterback who embraces his role as an underdog. Osweiler at his best is the anti-Manning. He doesn’t overthink it, checks his ego at the door, hands off the football or dumps it short with an easy throw, gets out of the way and lets Thomas or C.J. Anderson be the star. 

“My leadership is just who I am,” Osweiler said. “I’m not going to do anything special. Whatever my gut feeling is, or my gut thought, that’s coming out.” 

Brock being Brock, doing Teddy Brosevelt things. 

It just might work, dude.
