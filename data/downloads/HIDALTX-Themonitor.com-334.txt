Police were called to an apartment complex located in the 900 block of West Cherokee Avenue at approximately 10 p.m. “after receiving information that a female could be heard yelling for help,” according to a news release.


De La Cruz, 32, was “uncooperative in allowing officers to make sure everyone in the residence was safe,” the release states.


While the release does not address the standoff directly, it notes that Special Service assets were called to the scene to enter the home and arrest De La Cruz for assault-family violence.


De La Cruz was booked into the Hidalgo County jail Monday evening and his bond was set at $5,000. As of press time, he remained in jail.
