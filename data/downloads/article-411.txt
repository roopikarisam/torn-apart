For years, Sarpy County leaders watched as their jail got more and more crowded. They conducted studies and debated expansion options. They invested in alternatives to incarceration and hired the county’s first full-time corrections director.

All of these things helped to prolong the life of the facility, which was built in 1989.

But time is running out. The county must build a new jail, county officials say, and it needs to happen now.

“It’s not, ‘Do we build it?’ or ‘Do we not build it?’ ” said County Board member Jim Warren. “It’s a matter of ‘What do we build?’ ”

Exactly what a new jail will entail — its capacity, location, cost and funding — is up in the air. But the time frame is not. The project’s wheels are already turning. A new facility could be up and running in three years or so.

The county is far from alone in its fight with overcrowding — nearby counties, most notably Douglas and Cass Counties, face similar struggles. That leads to another problem: With nowhere nearby to take the 40 to 60 inmates every day who won’t fit in the jail, Sarpy must spend more to transport and house inmates farther from home.

Sarpy’s plan: Acquire land for a new facility by the end of this year. After that comes the design process, followed by construction, said Stu De La Castro, director of the county’s administrative services. An operational new jail is at least three years out, he said.

“And that’s if things go well,” said John Hubbard, director of corrections.

At a recent board meeting, the county decided to contract with Midwest Right of Way Services to help acquire a site, though one has yet to be selected. In the interest of killing two birds with one stone, the county hopes a new jail site will also be home to a new water treatment facility.

Leaders had previously explored adding onto the current jail, but that would be a pricier and less effective undertaking, said Megan Barrett, Sarpy’s spokeswoman.

Hubbard said building a new jail will allow for a more efficient space — one that’s staff-friendly, inmate-friendly and provider- friendly.

The facility’s woes aren’t new. When it was built in 1989 near 84th Street and Highway 370, it was supposed to be able to serve the county through 2020. But since the 1990s, the facility has regularly exceeded its capacity. The jail is designed for 148 beds, but on a day in early May, it held 154 inmates. That was on top of 39 inmates housed in other facilities.

As nearby jails also fill up, the county must transport inmates farther away. Inmates have been housed as far as halfway across the state, De La Castro said. That’s a burden on inmates’ families and on the courts, he said, not to mention the budget.

This year’s budget has $1.5 million for housing inmates elsewhere. That figure doesn’t include transportation costs, which can be hefty — once inmates make it to those other jails, they must be returned to Sarpy County for court appearances. By 2025, the county estimates that it will be spending $2.9 million annually to house inmates elsewhere.

Housing and transporting inmates elsewhere is not just expensive — it’s a lot of time on the road for Sarpy County sheriff’s deputies, said Chief Deputy Gregg London. And it’s dangerous.

London pointed to last year’s fatal shooting of Pottawattamie County Deputy Mark Burbridge, who was killed by an inmate he was transporting from a court appearance. “It is very dangerous having an inmate outside a secure facility like a jail,” London said.

In Douglas County, the story is similar. In March, Corrections Director Mark Foxall said the jail needed more space and more officers. Inmates were sleeping on floors, he told the board. And typically, jail populations go up during the summer months.

Douglas County’s average daily population is 1,273, per the Department of Corrections’ May 8 report. That’s a little down from the winter months, during which the population hovered around 1,300. The jail’s capacity is 1,452. Because of different requirements for different inmates, the jail is closer to capacity than those numbers indicate.

That’s the problem with routinely exceeding capacity in Sarpy, De La Castro said. Inmates can’t just be packed into any available space — they need to be housed according to a number of factors, including their offense, gender, and behavioral and mental health needs.

Sarpy’s jail lacks mental health and behavioral facilities and adequate programming space — things that weren’t considered part of a jail’s duties back in 1989.

Criminal justice consultant Mark Martin told the county in 2016 that though crime and the number of arrests were indeed down, inmates were staying at the jail longer. That length of stay depends on a number of factors — an inmate’s sentence, ability to afford bail and ability to pay fines. And many inmates come from outside of Sarpy County, mostly from Douglas County, Martin said. In 2015, more than half of inmates listed out-of-county residences.

Sarpy County Board member Don Kelly said the board has made building a new jail its top priority for this year. The budget also includes $250,000 for another jail study, which is underway, as well as preliminary design work. Board members also recently traveled to San Antonio to tour the Bexar County Jail.

The jail needs to be in a central location and be easily accessible to all of Sarpy’s law enforcement agencies as well as families of inmates and jail staff. But it needs to be off the beaten path enough to affect the smallest possible number of landowners.

It also needs to have an accompanying mental health facility. It should have adequate space for programming, which could include GED classes, anger management training and programs for domestic abuse victims. And it should be big enough and flexible enough to accommodate inmates with varying degrees of needs.

“We’d do this broad spectrum of things to help people ... be able to successfully re-enter society when they leave,” De La Castro said. “So we don’t have this big revolving door.”

A big piece of the puzzle is also keeping people out of jail or reducing their stay through incarceration alternatives, like house arrest, work release and pretrial programs. The county will continue to prioritize those, De La Castro said.

For the first week of May, Sarpy’s pretrial services had 257 people in its program. That’s 257 people not staying in the jail, said Barrett, the county spokeswoman.

The alternative programs allowed for the jail’s life to be extended, she said. But even with those programs, as the county’s population continues to grow, the number of inmates will grow, too.

Tye, Omaha Police Department

Tye, a 5-year-old Belgian Malinois from the Netherlands, is named after fallen officer Jason “Tye” Pratt. Just like his namesake, he loves goofing around with officers, but he is very serious when it comes to work. At home, he loves to lay around and loves when his cousins come visit or to be their show and tell at school. Tye was named K-9 of the Week!

Olaf lives with Bolda, along with recently-retired Police Service Dog Willy. Olaf likes playing fetch, having his chest scratched and playing with his "Kong" toy — although he also likes playing with medicine balls.
