Elgin police are asking anyone who may have recently received unauthorized parking citations on their cars in the downtown area to report the incidents.


Police were told by two residents this week that they returned to their vehicles — parked on Highland Avenue east of Douglas Avenue — to find tow notices on the car.


Although the stickers included "DNA" on the bottom — believed to mean the Downtown Neighborhood Association — neither the police department or the neighborhood association printed or placed the stickers, said Deputy Chief of Police Bill Wolf.


The stickers warned the residents they had parked for more than two hours and could be towed.


Elgin does enforce downtown parking time limits, Wolf said. The parking officer did not leave the stickers on the vehicles, however, and the stickers were not enforced by Elgin police.


"We enforce the timed parking spots pretty regularly," Wolf said.


The cars are believed to have been legally parked when someone posted the stickers, he added.


"It was very surprising that someone would go to the trouble to create something like that and put our initials on it. If there is a problem with parking, there is a better way to deal with that," said Jennifer Fukala, director of the Downtown Neighborhood Association.


Anyone else who has received the stickers is asked to contact parking control supervisor Brooke Rzeppa at 847-289-2573.
