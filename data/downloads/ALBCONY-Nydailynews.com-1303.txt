A Pennsylvania man is accused of strangling a woman and then attacking her with a hatchet after she refused to marry him.

Christopher Tucker, 34, was arrested on Halloween night at a rest stop in Illinois after he broke into a farmer's combine. Authorities in Illinois said Tucker wasn't making any sense so he was taken to a hospital for an evaluation. Police said that's when Tucker allegedly confessed to murdering 19-year-old Tara Serino.

According to the Morning Call, Tucker allegedly told investigators that he proposed to Serino, described in a criminal complaint as his "friend," at his Albany Township home. The teen said no and admitted that she had been sleeping with other men, police said.

Tucker said Serino made a comment that he should kill her and he "snapped." Tucker told police he choked the teen until he thought she was dead.

"He then poked her eyes out, snapped her neck and hit her with a hatchet until he knew she was dead," the criminal complaint stated. Police said he also used a 25-pound weight plate in the killing.

The Iroquois County Sheriff's Department contacted officers in Pennsylvania and told them to search Tucker's house. Upper Macungie police had already knocked on the front door to Tucker's home once before when Serino's father had reported her missing. When they returned the second time and searched inside, her body was found wrapped in a rug in the bedroom.

Tucker faces a number of charges including criminal homicide, first-degree murder and third-degree murder. He's being held at the Champaign County Jail awaiting extradition to Pennsylvania.
