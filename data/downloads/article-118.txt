Denver has agreed to pay $65,000 to settle a lawsuit filed by a former jail inmate who said he was injured after he fell from a stairwell during an epileptic seizure.

The inmate, Keith Gibson, was not supposed to be housed in an upper-level cell because of the risks associated with a potential seizure. However, deputies placed him in a third-floor cell, and Gibson had a seizure in July 2014. During the seizure Gibson careened over a stair rail and fell 10 to 12 feet onto a concrete floor.

He was taken to a hospital for treatment of his injuries, the lawsuit said.

Gibson also named the Colorado Department of Corrections and three of its employees in the same lawsuit. Gibson had been assigned a top bunk despite doctor’s orders that he sleep in a bottom bunk of his cell at the Fremont Correctional Facility.

Gibson fell from the top bunk during a seizure in November 2014, the lawsuit said. He also was injured in that fall.

The corrections department has not settled the lawsuit, said David Lane, a Denver civil rights attorney, who represents Gibson.

The settlement payment will be divided between Gibson and Lane’s law firm. Gibson will receive $37,774, and Killmer, Lane and Newman will receive $27,225, according to the Denver City Council’s meeting agenda.

Council will be asked to approve the settlement Monday night. Once approved, Denver and 10 sheriff’s department employees will be dropped as defendants.

Updated Sept. 18: Because of a reporting error, the amount of the settlement was originally misreported.
