Kathie Lee Gifford sticks by her friends â€” no matter what.

The "Today" co-host made a point to contact both Bill Cosby and Harvey Weinstein, with whom she has been friends for "a long, long time," after their respective scandals, she revealed on Andy Cohen's radio show Wednesday.

"I, personally, since I got into this business, as a teenage girl, I have been sexually harassed, I have been sexually abused and I have been date raped," Gifford, 64, said. "Don't tell me they're all the same, because they are not. They are not the same."

Cosby is currently awaiting a retrial for three counts of aggravated sexual assault of Andrea Constand. Dozens of other women have also accused him of drugging and assaulting them.

Weinstein, meanwhile, is under investigation by multiple police departments after being accused of sexual harassment and assault by more than 100 women.

"I don't want to throw everybody on the same manure pile. Being a jerk is not the same as being a rapist. It just isn't," Gifford told Cohen.

She also insisted only God can judge people.

"You can't call yourself a friend if the first minute there's trouble, you run. That's called a fair-weather friend, and that's not a friend at all," the daytime talk show host said.

"I hope people aren't misunderstanding this. I'm not saying that that kind of behavior is in any way acceptable. It isn't, and it's horrible, and as a woman who has experienced it, it's awful. But can we at least look at each individual case and see it for what it is? And be merciful to people who are sorry for what they've done?"

Gifford had previously talked about texting former "Today" co-host Matt Lauer the morning he was fired for sexual misconduct in November.

"If we stop having mercy as a part of our vocabulary," she said on the radio show Wednesday, "our world will completely die."
