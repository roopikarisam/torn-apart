ST. CHARLES â€“ St. Charles police officers responded to a five-car crash on Route 31 north of Wood Lane at 5:55 p.m. Nov. 30.

A Jeep Commander driven by Michael Potts, 25, of St. Charles, was traveling southbound on Route 31, when his vehicle struck a Volkswagen Jetta, driven by a 17-year-old girl from St. Charles, that was stopped in traffic, St. Charles Police Department Deputy Chief Dave Kintz stated in an email.

This resulted in a chain reaction pushing the Volkswagen into a Honda Pilot, driven by a 34-year-old woman from St. Charles, who was waiting to make a left turn, Kintz stated.

The 17-year-old driver of the Volkswagen and the 34-year-old driver of the Honda were taken to Northwestern Medicine Delnor Hospital in Geneva by the Fox River and Countryside Fire/Rescue District with non-life threatening injuries, Kintz stated.

Four of the vehicles involved in the incident had to be towed away, Kintz stated.
