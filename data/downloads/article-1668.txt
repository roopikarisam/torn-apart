From Brooklyn to Beijing, it’s been quite a ride for Stephon Marbury.

The Coney Island native is finally retiring from basketball at the end of the season just a few days before his 41st birthday, Marbury told The Undefeated. He has spent the past eight seasons playing in the Chinese Basketball Association.

“One hundred percent,” Marbury said when asked if he was at peace with the decision. “Man, I got three championships in a foreign country where I don’t speak the language. People don’t know how hard it is to play in China. They think it’s easy for the foreign players. But it’s really not. It’s really difficult.

“You can ask guys like J.R. [Smith] and Tracy [McGrady] how difficult it was. It’s not just so much about your ability to score. It’s about being able to try to win. I accomplished so much in doing something where basketball has taken off, heightened to a whole other level. And I had something to do with it.”

The kid who became “Starbury” went from Abraham Lincoln High School to Georgia Tech and then 13 years in the NBA. Eight of them were spent between the Nets or the Knicks. He was a two-time NBA All-Star, but there was still some disappointment for a player whose ceiling as an amateur was “potential all-time great.”

He became a national treasure in China, though. Marbury was a six-time All-Star and the CBA Finals MVP in 2015. There is a statue of him outside the Beijing Ducks arena.

Marbury wanted to play in the NBA this season before calling it quits, and said he’ll stay in shape in case there is one last phone call from the league. His CBA season ends Feb. 11.

He’s not ruling out playing in the Big 3 league, but doubts he’ll do it. There are business ventures in China that will keep him busy in his retirement.

Maybe there will even be a Basketball Hall of Fame speech to deliver in his future.

“My numbers are Hall of Fame,” Marbury said. “That’s first. You look at guys who have never won championships on the globe, they are in the Hall of Fame. Two, what I have done to help basketball globally to bridge the gap from America to China, with China being one of the main components on the Earth for basketball, that right there alone should bridge that gap. It’s the Basketball Hall of Fame, not the NBA Hall of Fame. So, for basketball, I played in Olympics, I played in the Junior Olympics. With what I’ve done and given to basketball is all Hall of Fame.”
