RAYMONDVILLE — Police have a suspect in the hit-and-run accident that critically injured a cyclist.


Investigators were preparing a probable cause affidavit to request a judge issue an arrest warrant, Police Chief Uvaldo Zamora said yesterday.


“Everything they’ve found they’re putting together to present to a judge to prove there’s probable cause to issue an arrest warrant,” Zamora said.

Zamora said investigators have identified the driver of a light-colored SUV believed to be the vehicle that struck Ruben Serna, 56, as he rode a bicycle Nov. 18.


Serna remains in critical condition at Valley Baptist Medical Center in Harlingen, hospital spokeswoman Teri Retana said late yesterday afternoon.


The suspect is the man whose photograph was captured by a local Stripes convenience store camera after the accident, Zamora said.

Police, he said, have matched witnesses’ descriptions of a vehicle pulling a boat believed to have struck Serna as he rode his bicycle on the shoulder of the road in front of the Otis Klar Head Start center on East FM 186 about 7 a.m. Nov. 18.


Serna, believed to be from Houston, was living in Raymondville, where he is believed to have been working at an area ranch, Zamora said.
