Brazilian national Fabiano de Oliveira — free and home after a month in immigration detention — says that being arrested as he tried to get a green card for marrying the mother of his child has not deterred his faith in America.


“I still have the American dream to be successful,” de Oliveira, 33, told the Herald yesterday. “We cannot have the life we have here down there (Brazil). My son is not going to have the education. His chances here are way better.”
