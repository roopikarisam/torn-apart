A Seguin family said the Texas Tech community was in their thoughts and prayers Monday, a week after their son was charged with murder in the death of a police officer there.

Hollis "Reid" Daniels, 19, was booked into the Lubbock County Detention Center Oct.9 after he shot and killed Officer Floyd East, Jr., who had brought the Texas Tech student into the police station on a drug possession charge, police said.

Daniels is from Seguin, where his father was a city council member and his family owned the local theatre. In a statement to myhighplains.com Monday, the family said their prayers go out to East's family.

The family's attorney, Chuck Lanehart, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The statement reads:

"The Hollis Daniels family wishes to express its deepest sorrow, unimaginable grief, and heartfelt sympathy for all those affected by the death of Officer Floyd East, Jr. Officer East was a dedicated police officer who selflessly served others, and his death is a devastating loss for all. In this time of unimaginable pain, loss, and heartbreak, our thoughts and prayers go out to Officer East's family, friends and colleagues, and every person whose life has been touched by this senseless and unspeakable tragedy."
