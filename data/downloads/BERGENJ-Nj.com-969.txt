A real estate agent who pocketed clients' down payments has been sent to prison and was ordered to pay the money.

According to court documents, Peter Live, 42, of Newark was convicted on second-degree theft and was sentenced to five years in prison on May 4. He pleaded guilty in February. 

In addition to jail time, Live was ordered to pay back approximately $348,000 in restitution.

Live was caught in his scheme after five of his clients from his Fort Lee-based real estate company made complaints with the Fort Lee Police between Dec. 2016 and June 2017.

The clients said they made down payments for real estate purchases to Live.

Instead of putting the money in escrow, he kept it and and never completing any of the real estate transactions, authorities said.
