Essex County authorities announced Monday they've charged a Newark man with gunning down two brothers in the city last month, and he's been arrested in San Jose, California.

Marquise Jones, 22, is being held at a county jail in San Jose following his Saturday night arrest there by the San Jose Police Dept., Acting Essex County Prosecutor Robert D. Laurino and Newark Public Safety Director Anthony F. Ambrose announced.

Jones is charged with two counts of murder and several related charges for the April 25 killings of Quan Harmon, 20, and Quamir Harmon, 21. The brothers were shot dead in the 900 block of Bergen Street.

Essex authorities did not elaborate on Jones' apparent travel to California or how he was located there. He is expected to be extradited to New Jersey in the near future.

The investigation into the Harmon brothers' killings continues.
