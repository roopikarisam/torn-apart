Retired Elgin police Sgt. William C. "Bill" Wood, indicted on a charge that he stole money from the Elgin police union, turned himself in Wednesday at the Kane County Sheriff's Office.


Wood was booked into the jail and then released on $3,000 bond. His next court date is scheduled for May 10.


Wood is accused of taking more than $34,000 from Elgin Police Benevolent and Protective Association Unit No. 54, for which he was the treasurer and president from 2007 to 2013. He was charged with class 2 felony theft.


Kane County State's Attorney Joe McMahon said the missing money seemed to be "co-mingled" with personal funds.


Wood retired from the Elgin Department on Aug. 15, just a week after the police union asked for a police investigation into the discrepancies discovered with its accounts.


According to court records, Wood is now living in Slidell, La.


His attorney, Gary Johnson, said Wood will be allowed to travel back and forth between court dates.


He had no other comments on the charges.
