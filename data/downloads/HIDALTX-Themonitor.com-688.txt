EDINBURG — A man was arraigned on multiple aggravated robbery charges Wednesday after allegedly robbing a string of small businesses in western Hidalgo County last week.


Romeo Ochoa Jr., 41, was arraigned on five counts of aggravated robbery, a first-degree felony carrying a sentence of up to 99 years in prison if convicted.

Three of the charges come from the Hidalgo County Sheriff’s Office, and investigators said Ochoa robbed three businesses at gunpoint in less than half an hour on April 27. He stole a combined $407, in addition to jewelry, from Snow Wiz at 2900 N. La Homa Road, La Fruteria Stand at 6118 W. Mile 5 Road, and La Reynera Bakery at 6115 Mile 3 Road.


The other two charges come from the Alton and La Joya Police Departments, which did not release information about the location of the robberies.

Ochoa’s bond was set at $1.25 million, and he remains in custody at the Hidalgo County jail.
