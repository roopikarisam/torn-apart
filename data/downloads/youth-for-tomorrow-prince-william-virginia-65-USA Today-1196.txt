Carmelo Anthony told reporters that he was able to help send 4,500 kids from Baltimore to the March for Our Lives rally in Washington, D.C., on Saturday. The day before, the 10-time All-Star tweeted that he partnered with the city of Baltimore, MTV and the NAACP to make it happen.

More than one million people marched to call for an end to gun violence on Saturday in D.C. and around the world.

As the Thunder prepare to face the Trail Blazers in Oklahoma City on Sunday, Anthony said, per video from OKC beat writer Fred Katz:

“From a national standpoint, yes, I was able to get involved, help out in Baltimore, teamed up with the city of Baltimore. We sent 4,500 kids to D.C. to the march. Maybe 90 buses from Baltimore to D.C., so to see how it’s unfolding, see the impact the youth are having right now, it’s a special moment — especially for me — just for everybody to see how powerful the youth are right now and the voices are being heard right now. That’s the most important part.”

When Anthony was then asked if he plans to continue being an activist after he retires from the NBA, the Thunder forward replied:

“I think activism is just either you do it or you don’t. It’s not something you look forward or you gotta plan it out. It’s something that’s gotta come natural. I think I will always be part of or active when it comes to activism and speaking up when it has things to do with communities and people and different issues we go through today. That’s just a natural thing for me.”

Anthony and Dwyane Wade tweeted their support for March for Our Lives two weeks ago when they asked others from the NBA family to join them in donating money.

On the day of the marches, others in the sports world made statements to show their support.

The New England Patriots owner Bob Kraft also helped send students and families of the 17 victims who were killed by a gunman in the high school shooting in Parkland, Florida, to D.C. after former Arizona representative Gabrielle Giffords and her husband, Mark Kelly, asked him to allow them to use the team plane, according to The Boston Globe.
