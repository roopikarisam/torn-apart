A man was arrested Saturday evening on suspicion of physically assaulting two children who pranked him at his Queen Creek home, according to the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office. 


Johnathan Larocque, 22, was arrested about 10 p.m., MCSO spokesman Sgt. Calbert Gillett said.


Several kids had been going to homes in Larocque's neighborhood, near Ellsworth Road and San Tan Boulevard, and ringing doorbells before running away in a prank known as "ding-dong ditching," Gillett said.


After Larocque's home became a part of the prank, he caught up with two of the children and physically assaulted them, Gillett said.


One of the kids had to be taken to the hospital for treatment, but none of the children's injuries were life-threatening, according to MCSO.


Larocque was booked into jail on two counts of aggravated assault, Gillett said. Additional charges are possible pending the results of an ongoing investigation.
