Pleading ignorance isn't cutting it in the eyes of Melissa Weishaupt.

The former Dallas Mavericks employee, one of several to speak out about against former Mavs predisent Terdema Ussery and the organization's hostile work enviroment in a Sports Illustrated piece in February, says it isn't acceptable for owner Mark Cuban to claim innoncence by cimply saying he only oversees the basketball side of his franchise.

"Sorry. It doesn't work that way," Weishaupt says in a story she penned for SI.com Tuesday. "You own 100% of the team, Mark. The buck stops with you. When I worked on the Mavs' business side, all marketing, promotional and broadcasting decisions went through you. Nothing was decided without your approval."

Weishaupt slams Cuban for failing to "recognize the culture he's helped create or the plight of the women who still work for him."

She also commended Mavs head coach Rick Carlisle and star Dirk Nowitzki for choosing not to "duck questions" or "blame the victims" despite never beind accused of anything.

Weishaupt goes on to explain the reason why so many of her fellow accusers chose to remain anonymous, saying that the human resources department is "not always a safe haven" and explained that people were reluctant to complain out of worry they could be fired at any time.

However, she chose not to withhold her name, instead serving as a face for the rest of her fellow colleagues and represent them against those denying the sexual harassment accusations.

"Yes, I was harassed while I worked for the Mavericks," Weishaupt writes. "But I am using my name now because I will never say that I am a victim. I am tougher. I am wiser. I am my own advocate."
