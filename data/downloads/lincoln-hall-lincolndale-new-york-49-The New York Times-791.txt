Good morning on this damp Friday. Snow is coming tomorrow.


This long weekend is brought to you by Presidents’ Day.


The holiday on Monday, officially called Washington’s Birthday, celebrates our first president (and now, Abraham Lincoln and others), but it can also be an occasion to honor our first ladies — one-fifth of whom were born in New York.


Elizabeth Monroe, Eleanor Roosevelt, Nancy Reagan and Barbara Bush were born in the city; Hannah Van Buren, Abigail Fillmore and Frances Folsom Cleveland upstate; Jacqueline Kennedy in Southampton and Julia Tyler on Long Island.


Martha Washington was not a New Yorker but a Virginian, yet she was New York’s first first lady, a mantle she assumed when George Washington took his presidential oath at Federal Hall in Manhattan in 1789. (New York, like Philadelphia, was a temporary capital.)

More than a century later, around 1903, New York paid homage to the first first lady with the Martha Washington, a women-only hotel at 30 East 30th Street.


A novel concept at the time, it quickly became a symbol of advancement and independence for female professionals.


It was declared a city landmark in 2012, and today it’s the site of Danny Meyer’s pizzeria Marta.


You can learn more about our first ladies on Saturday, Sunday and Monday at the New-York Historical Society on the Upper West Side, where you’ll meet re-enactors playing Martha Washington, Dolley Madison and others.


That might be a good outing for public school students, who will be kicking off a week without school for midwinter recess.

Here’s what else is happening:


Rain on and off for much of the day and still warm, with temperatures hovering in the low 50s.


Chillier tomorrow, then tomorrow night: 4 to 7 inches of snow, if temperatures stay low enough.


Enjoy it while you can — much of it will melt on Sunday, with highs around 45. On Monday, clouds and maybe some rain.

Happy Year of the Dog!


The Year of the Dog, a reflection of the loyal bond between humans and dogs, is a year to “celebrate friendship or your family relationship,” said Shenzhan Liao, the director of the school of Chinese studies at the China Institute, a cultural and education center in downtown Manhattan.


It has an added layer of meaning, Ms. Liao told us. In Chinese, Wàng (汪), the word describing a dog’s bark (equivalent to “woof”), sounds the same as the word for thriving (旺).


So by wishing your neighbors a Happy Year of the Dog, Ms. Liao explained, you’re also wishing them a year of prosperity.


City public schools are closed today in observance of the Lunar New Year, and there will be holiday festivities — beyond parades — across the city through the end of the month.


Today, join a firecracker ceremony on the Lower East Side, family programs in Prospect Park, or “Students Day” with free performances and dancing in the lobby of David Geffen Hall at Lincoln Center.


On Saturday, learn about auspicious plants at the Queens Botanical Garden or the Asian roots of the wild dog at the Prospect Park Zoo.


On Sunday, celebrate the Year of the Dog with a dog social (and dog-friendly hike) on Staten Island.


Next week, catch the Dragon Dance and Year of the Dog Dance on Lincoln Center Plaza, or a New York Philharmonic Lunar New Year performance at Lincoln Center.

And next weekend, check out a Chinese New Year Family Festival at the China Institute in Lower Manhattan, or the annual Lunar New Year Parade in Chinatown.


There will be no New York Today on Monday, in observance of Presidents’ Day. We’ll be back on Tuesday.
