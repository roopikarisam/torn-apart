Good morning on this suddenly snowy Monday.


Surprise!


Outside your window, a small spring snowstorm is busy blanketing our region.


The fast-moving storm blew in last night and could drop three to five inches of heavy, wet snow on the city by this afternoon.


The snowfall is predicted to be heaviest until 11 a.m. — perfectly timed to muck up your morning commute.


(Before heading out, check for service changes on the subway, Metro-North, the Long Island Rail Road, New Jersey Transit and Amtrak.)

With temperatures hovering around freezing this morning, you may want to pop on your earmuffs and take an umbrella, as the snow could be mixed with rain by this afternoon.


A winter weather advisory is in effect until 2 p.m., which means roads could be slippery and visibility may be reduced.


But whatever you do, don’t call this storm a nor’easter.


While we may have just celebrated a rare “four’easter,” with four nor’easters pummeling our region within a month, today’s storm will not be the fifth.


“The magnitude of this storm is not quite up to par,” said John Murray, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service.


For a storm to qualify as a nor’easter, he explained, it must meet a few conditions, including sustained winds of 34 knots, or around 39 miles per hour. Wind gusts today are expected to reach only 25 miles per hour, leaving the storm with the less-sexy label of “quick-moving low pressure system.”

Still, the storm was strong enough to postpone the Yankees home opener against the Tampa Bay Rays until tomorrow.


Expect to forget all about it by this afternoon, when we should see sunshine and a high of 44. April showers — two days of them — start tomorrow.
