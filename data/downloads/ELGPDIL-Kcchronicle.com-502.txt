BATAVIA – No one was injured but two homes were deemed uninhabitable after a garage fire spread to nearby townhomes Friday night in Batavia.

First responders were dispatched just after 8:15 p.m. Friday for a report of a garage fire involving a vehicle in the 400 block of Mill Street in Batavia, according to a news release from the Batavia Fire Department.

Batavia police officers were first on the scene and reported a home was fully engulfed in flames. Batavia firefighters then asked for assistance from nine other fire agencies to help extinguish the blaze.

When firefighters arrived, they reported one townhome in a row of five townhomes had caught fire. The fire had spread to either side of the original home involved, and it took firefighters roughly 40 minutes to bring the fire under control. Some crews remained on the scene until just before 11 p.m.

Two homes were deemed uninhabitable because of the damage, and no one was injured.

The Batavia Fire Department continues to investigate the fire's cause.

A damage cost estimate was not yet available Saturday afternoon, Batavia Fire Battalion Chief John Lucas said.

Firefighters from Elburn, Geneva, North Aurora, South Elgin, St. Charles, Sugar Grove, Warrenville and West Chicago assisted those from Batavia. Fermilab firefighters covered the Batavia Fire Department's stations during the blaze.
