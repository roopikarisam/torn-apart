A recently approved 3 percent raise for Naperville Park District Executive Director Ray McGury locks him in as the highest paid park director in the area with a base salary of $207,618.


McGury, hired to lead the park district in 2008, is also set to collect $5,634.28 a month in pension payments from the 21 years he spent with the Naperville Police Department, according to the Naperville Police Pension Fund board.


In addition to his base salary, McGury was also approved for $10,000 in deferred compensation and $7,200 in auto allowance for 2018. The parks director has been receiving the car allowance and deferred compensation in those amounts since 2015.


Prior to taking the helm at the Naperville Park District, McGury worked for 21 years for the Naperville Police Department, where he rose to the rank of police captain. After retiring from the department in August 2005, McGury was hired as police chief in Bolingbrook, a position he held from 2005 to 2008.


While McGury's base salary for 2017 tops that of other park leaders in the area, park district attorney Derke Price notes that the Naperville district has nearly 200 more employees than the Fox Valley Park District as well as its own police force. Naperville's budget and operations are double the size of the St. Charles Park District and unlike the Elgin Parks and Recreation Department, the Naperville district is its own unit of local government, Price said.


Fox Valley Park District Director James Pilmer's base salary in 2017 was $158,510. St. Charles Park District Director Holly Cabel was paid $148,234 and Elgin Parks and Recreation Director Randy Reopelle had a base salary of $143,066 in 2017, according to public documents.


McGury said he was reluctant to discuss his compensation.


"I work for the taxpayers and their board of commissioners, so it’s not for me to comment on my performance or what they think,” McGury said. “I remain honored to have the opportunity to lead a district that enriches the quality of life of residents through quality programming and recreation facilities.”

In his nearly 10 years as district director, McGury has helmed some major projects, including construction of the Nike Sports Complex, which came in under budget; restoration and environmental cleanup of Sportsmans Park, making the space available to the public for the first time in 30 years; and construction of the year-old Fort Hill Activity Center.


McGury's original contract ran through Sept. 15, 2009, and was extended by three years. The agreement kept McGury's salary at $135,000 and made him eligible for 3 percent annual pay raises beginning in 2010. At the same time, the board approved a $500 per month auto allowance and $6,000 annually in deferred compensation, according to the contract.


In 2010, McGury's contract was extended through Dec. 31, 2012, and amended to increase his base salary to $150,000 in 2011.


Two years later, McGury's contract was extended through Dec. 31, 2015. The deal specified that "each Jan. 1 an additional year shall automatically be added to the term of this agreement unless the district notifies McGury in writing of the district's decision not to renew this agreement by the preceding Dec. 31. In the event that the district does notify McGury in writing that the district has not decided to renew the agreement, this agreement will then lapse at the end of the three-year term that is in effect at the time such notification is given."


Also in 2012, McGury's base salary was raised to $160,000, with an annual increase of at least 2 percent each year and a minimum 1 percent merit-based increase if he met his job requirements. The park director continued to receive $6,000 in deferred compensation, and his monthly auto allowance was increased to $600.


An auto allowance is given because "the executive director represents the park district at many different functions," said Katie Sepe, director of human resources for the Naperville Park District." The allowance pays for the professional use of McGury's personal vehicle, and he is neither provided a park district vehicle nor can he submit for mileage reimbursements, Sepe said.


Also included in the agreement was that McGury would not accept any offer of employment from the City of Naperville or any park district or municipal parks and recreation department located north of Interstate 80 any time before Jan. 1, 2014.


"Several years ago, a neighboring unit of government offered Ray a much greater compensation package (more than $25,000 higher than his compensation from the Naperville Park District at the time)," Price said. "Ray informed the board and the parties entered into a new contract that adjusted his compensation and, within the constraints of the park code, incentivized Ray to remain with the park district."


McGury and the park district board in 2015 agreed to a contract amendment that became effective May 1, 2015, in which McGury's salary was increased to $190,000, and his annual deferred compensation payments were increased from $6,000 to $10,000.


Also included in the most recent contract amendment is a "continuity of service" section. Under this section, McGury is guaranteed a minimum six month's severance pay if he serves as park district director through Dec. 31, 2020, even if he resigns. In the event of McGury's resignation after Dec. 31, 2018, McGury is guaranteed a minimum of three month's severance pay, according to the contract amendment.
