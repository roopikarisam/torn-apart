A former bookkeeper has been accused of stealing more than $841,000 from the Pine-Strawberry Water Improvement District and a private business in north-central Arizona.


The Arizona Attorney General's Office announced Monday that 60-year-old Rebecca Sigeti was indicted by a state grand jury and is facing 40 felony charges including theft, misuse of public monies and fraudulent schemes and artifices.


Investigators said Sigeti allegedly embezzled the money from her employers by issuing authorized checks to herself for her own personal use.


Sigeti is alleged to have stolen nearly $525,000 from the Pine-Strawberry Water Improvement District and more than $316,000 from the Sunny Mountain Realty.


Authorities say the monies came from customer security deposits and water-use payments,Â plus taxpayer property tax payments that should have been used to support district operations.
