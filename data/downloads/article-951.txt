Authorities in Southern Calilfornia arrested U.S. Marine Jerel Boykins in connection with the shooting death of his estranged wife, the Orange County Sheriff's Department said.

Boykins, who was reportedly stationed in North Carolina, returned to California several days ago and began stalking Yahaira Ocegueda Boykins, KTLA reports.

Deputies responded to a call at around 2:30 p.m. Thursday and discovered the body of the 23-year-old victim.

She had multiple gunshot wounds on her body. The Orange County Fire Authority was called in to provide first aid, but was unable to revive the victim, according to a statement released by the sheriff.

Police have yet to release the woman's name but it was reported byKTLA, which quoted several people who knew her.

One friend of the victim told the station that Boykins had a volatile temper and repeatedly threatened to kill his wife.

The friend added that even after his transfer to a Marine base in North Carolina, Boykins allegedly continued to harass his estranged wife through texts and phone calls, which she refused to answer.

She's thought to have been the mother of three children. Two of the three kids were Boykins', the friend said. It's unclear where the children were at the time of the shooting.

The sheriff's release reveals that Boykins was booked into the Orange County Jail, where he remains on $1 million bond.

The U.S. Marine is being held on suspicion of murder.

Boykins is set to face a judge on Sept. 18.

A GoFundMe has been set up to help the victim's family pay for costs associated with her funeral.
