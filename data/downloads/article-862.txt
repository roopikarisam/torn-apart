Four members of a Spotsylvania County family have been arrested following the recent birth of an opiate-addicted baby, authorities said.

Spotsylvania Sheriff’s Capt. Liz Scott said the county’s Department of Social Services recently received an anonymous tip that a 23-year-old woman had given birth in her family’s home. The caller was concerned because the baby was a month premature and was likely born addicted to narcotics, Scott said.

Scott said detectives learned that the child was born in the home off Adamson Lane. But she said family members would not cooperate in the investigation into the whereabouts of the mother or the child.

The mother, Georgia McClung, was already wanted on a narcotics-related probation violation and Scott said detectives were anxious to find the child because of possible medical problems, Scott said.

On Thursday, deputies made a traffic stop near the residence and arrested the baby’s grandmother and two uncles. They also learned that Georgia McClung was at a residence in Stafford County, Scott said.

With the assistance of the Stafford Sheriff’s Office, Scott said, the baby was found and taken to a local hospital for treatment. Scott said the child is being treated for Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome due to the child’s symptoms and the mother’s drug use during the pregnancy.

Georgia McClung was arrested on a probation violation and new charges of child neglect and showing a reckless disregard for life. Her mother, Brenda McClung, was also charged with child neglect and reckless disregard for life.

Brendt McClung, 26, and Michael McClung, 35, were charged with possession of heroin. Those charges stemmed from Thursday’s traffic stop. All four family members were placed in the Rappahannock Regional Jail.

Scott said the investigation is ongoing.
