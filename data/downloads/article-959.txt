A Florida man accused of killing his infant daughter told cops he was stressed out beforehand because Hurricane Irma knocked out power to his home, according to a new report.

Dekari Rashard Castell, 22, who was arrested Monday on murder and aggravated child abuse charges, told cops he hit his 6-month-old, Kali Dream, twice in the head because she wouldn’t stop crying, the Orlando Sentinel reported.

The child was taken to the hospital on Sept. 13 and died the next day.

Castell told Orlando police he was “highly stressed” as a result of being without power.

He was also accused of breaking his 4-week-old son’s leg last year by the Florida Department of Children and Families but no charges were filed, according to local Fox affiliate Fox35.

The dad is being held without bond in Orange County Jail. Police didn’t immediately return a call.
