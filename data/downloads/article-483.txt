Three members of the Omaha community have been honored for embodying the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.’s vision and beliefs.

Deputy Omaha Police Chief Greg Gonzalez, Tanya Burnside with the Douglas County Department of Corrections and civil rights veteran Tommie Wilson were recognized Friday during the Living the Dream awards ceremony at the City-County Building.

Franklin Thompson, director of Omaha’s Human Rights and Relations Department, presented the award to Gonzalez, a 23-year veteran of the Omaha Police Department. Gonzalez has helped start and expand the Police Athletics for Community Engagement program, which steers at-risk and disadvantaged youths into sports to deter them from street gangs, crime and drug use.

“His value and ethics echo Dr. King’s hope for higher standards, just treatment, respect and inclusivity,” Thompson said, reading from Gonzalez’s nomination letter.

Karen Buche, director of Douglas County human resources, presented the award to Burnside, who was recognized in part for her compassion, vision and work on the No Bars project. The project helps at-risk youths avoid incarceration and limits their exposure to violence.

Wilson, a longtime civil rights champion, was honored for her efforts to combat segregation in education.

A handful of public officials also offered their remarks on King’s message, including Police Chief Todd Schmaderer and Mayor Jean Stothert, who said each recipient has a passion for service and equality.

Friday’s program also included musical presentations by the Omaha Burke High School show choir and a keynote address by James Hunter. Hunter, a member of Omaha’s Human Rights and Relations Board, brought all in attendance one final message for the evening.

“Aspire to inspire. That’s our theme,” he said. “Throughout his life Martin Luther King Jr. was frequently faced with the very worst that people had to offer one another. But rather than give in, he chose to aspire to inspire.”
