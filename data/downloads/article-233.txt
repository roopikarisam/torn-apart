PLYMOUTH — The body of a 64-year old Mashpee man has been found in Plymouth.


The Cape and Islands District Attorney’s Office said yesterday that Raymond Perry’s body was found near the Carver line by officers from Mashpee, Plymouth and the state police.
  


The state Medical Examiner’s office ruled the death a homicide by “blunt force trauma to the head” and “cutting wounds to the neck.”


Perry was reported missing Dec. 1 by the mother of two of Perry’s granddaughters after he didn’t show up at two planned visits.
