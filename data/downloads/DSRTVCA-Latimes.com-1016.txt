Hello, my name is John Cherwa and welcome back to our horse racing newsletter as we congratulate Justify on winning the first two legs of the Triple Crown.

Justify’s win in the Preakness Stakes added a lot of intrigue to the Belmont Stakes. I was among the ones who thought he was invincible and would handily put away this field. But, when he emerged from the fog, he looked vulnerable.

I, along with a few other reporters, were standing with Bob Baffert watching on a small 24-inch monitor in the paddock. He let out a little “Uh, oh,” when he saw Justify wasn’t running away with things. But, the colt held on for the win.

The optimist view is that Justify actually won the Preakness Stakes in a bounce (bad race following a good one) and that he’s so good he can win a Triple Crown race not at his best.

Baffert explained that American Pharoah’s Kentucky Derby race was not very good. It wasn’t until he won the Preakness that he became the star he became. OK, I can buy that. Maybe this was Justify’s bad race.

Or, then there’s the idea that we have overhyped this lightly raced colt. You can count me among the guilty if this is true. Hopefully, we’ll get to find out the answers in three weeks.

I have to say, neither Mike Smith nor Baffert showed any great concern in the post-race news conference. Then again, we didn’t to see the race because of the fog. Might as well have a re-enactment with badly drawn cartoon horses to explain what happened.

But, the most interesting question is if the ownership group of WinStar Farm and China Horse Club, which owns both Justify and Audible, will run Audible in the Belmont Stakes off five weeks rest. Elliott Walden, the managing partner of the syndicate, smiled when I asked him that question.

“I knew somebody was going to ask me that,” he said. “No thoughts today, probably make a decision late in the week. We’ll see. I’m non-committal both ways.”

I’m hoping they do run him because if they don’t and Justify wins, then some will view it as a somewhat tainted Triple Crown because he didn’t face the best because of compromised ownership interest. Walden is a smart guy, let’s hope he chooses the right legacy.

Santa Anita review

In Santa Anita’s lone stakes race on Saturday, Cordiality won the $100,000 Fran’s Valentine Stakes, going a mile on the turf for Cal-bred fillies and mares. The winning jockey was Gary Stevens who picked up the mount when Tyler Baze was taken to the hospital after being involved in a spill in the sixth race. Baze’s mount, Fast Munny, suffered a fatal heart attack in the stretch, throwing Baze, who was taken to the hospital but released two hours later.

Stevens had been riding in Oaklawn but returned to Santa Anita on Thursday.

“I was a little concerned she might be a little rank [Saturday] because of the trouble line (“Pulled. Steadied early) in the Form from her last race,” Stevens said. “But [trainer] Mark [Glatt] said he was confident she’d settle. That’s the only reason she was rank last time was because it was her first time running down the hill in a long time.”

Cordiality finished 1 ¾ lengths in front of She Carmelita. Cheekaboo, coming off a year’s layoff, finished third.

Cordiality paid $11.20, $5.40 and $4.00.

Santa Anita preview

It’s one of those hangover-after-a-big-day cards with nine races starting at 12:30 p.m. As a matter of fact, most race tracks use all their bullets on Saturday of Preakness day. Santa Anita used up a lot of horses with a 12-race card.

There are four turf races, three of them down the hill. The one that’s not is the ninth race, the feature. It’s the $100,000 Crystal Water Stakes for Cal-bred 3-year-olds and up going a mile on the turf.

Veteran campaigner Ashleylovessugar, a 7-year-old gelding, is the morning-line favorite at 7-2. He’s won 10 of 24 races lifetime. He’ll be running for trainer Peter Eurton and ridden by Flavien Prat, who was in Baltimore on Saturday riding just one horse on the undercard. Ashleylovessugar hasn’t raced since August when he was caught in the Del Mar Handicap. That race is 3/8ths of a mile longer than Sunday’s.

Rye, whose last race was a third in the 1 3/4-mile San Juan Capistrano, really gets shorted up for this race. He’s at 4-1.

The field sizes, in order: 8, 5 (yikes!), 8, 6, 11, 8, 12, 7, 12.

Bob Ike’s SA play of the day

NINTH RACE: No. 12 Camino Del Paraiso (6-1)

Must overcome far outside post but always been a fan of this gelding based in Northern California with the O.J. Jauregui barn. Ended a long drought with an easy win over the Golden Gate synthetic last time but has run well over this course and can spring a minor upset if he works out any kind of trip.

Saturday’s result: Best Two Minutes (7-2) got a good trip but couldn't make impact on the winner and was all out to be second at the wire.

Bob Ike is a Partner/VP of Horsebills.com (here’s a video) and the proprietor of BobIkePicks.com (full-card picks, 3 Best Plays and betting strategy).

Ed Burgart LA play of the day

FIFTH RACE: No. 5 Mayas Signature (2-1)

She ran much better than her 20-1 debut odds when dropping a head photo after a sluggish start from the outside post where she veered out several lanes early. Filly leveled nicely midway and finished with a rush while one length clear of the third horse. I would make exacta boxes with #9 Seein Starz and #1 Separatefromothers. The latter know both had excuses in their debuts.
