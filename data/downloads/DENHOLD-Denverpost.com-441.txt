There are a couple of days a year when even people who don’t normally brunch decide to brunch. (Mother’s Day and Easter, we’re looking at you.)

Denver is very much a brunch town, and there’s no shortage of spots willing to fry you up some eggs and explore the fascinating depths of your mimosa and bloody Mary tolerance, but for your Easter Sunday brunch, we know you’re looking for something with a little extra oomph. Maybe an egg hunt for the kids, or one-day-only special menu items, or vanilla bean waffles with Reese’s cookie butter. These should all be options when it comes to Easter brunching.

Here are 13 spots where your morning meal on Sunday, April 1, will be so festive that even the brunch hold-outs may become converts.

Maybe you don’t want to battle the crowds on Sunday, or maybe you’re just really bad with dates; no matter, The Bindery has you covered with a weekend-long Easter brunch event. On Saturday, kids can hunt for eggs inside the restaurant and on the patio from 8 to 9 a.m. On Sunday, a special brunch menu will be served from 9 a.m. until 3 p.m., and will include carrot buttermilk waffles and an Easter eggs benedict on a “nest” of shredded potatoes. Plus, kids get a special sweet treat. 1817 Central St., Denver, 303-993-2364; thebinderydenver.com

When you consider that getting photos with the Easter Bunny at the mall can cost $30, Cattivella’s bunny brunch is a steal. Kids can grab photos with the rabbit, and everyone can savor the special Italian pastries, pizzas and carving station. $40 for four courses; 10195 E. 29th Dr., Denver, 303-645-3779; cattivelladenver.com; 9 a.m.-2 p.m.

Four words to ensure you have a great (and stress-free) Easter meal: dedicated playroom for kids.

Meanwhile, the grown-ups will enjoy a chilled seafood display and carbs galore. $44 for adults, $22 for kids, free for kids 6 and under; 150 Clayton Lane, Denver, 303-253-3000; jwmarriottdenver.com; 8 a.m.-2 p.m.

Horchata pancakes plus Mexican mimosas plus an Easter egg hunt for the kids (at 9:45 a.m.) sounds like the perfect Easter brunch. Go get it at Lola Costal Mexican. 1575 Boulder St., Denver, 720-570-8686; loladenver.com; 9:45 a.m.-1:30 p.m.

Tavernetta’s first official brunch looks to be a doozy: There will be pasta and lardo and doughnuts and pretty much everything else that’s good in the world. 1889 16th St., Denver, 720-605-1889; tavernettadenver.com; 10 a.m.-2:30 p.m.

Each Easter morning, the Tavern restaurants turn ultra family-friendly, with a traditional Easter brunch, candy-filled eggs for kids and a visit from the big bunny himself. $35 for adults, $12 for kids, free for kids 6 and under; available at Lowry, Tech Center, Littleton and Platt Park locations; tavernhg.com; 10 a.m.-2 p.m.

If fancy is what you’re after, then don your best Easter bonnet and head up to Boulder’s iconic Flagstaff House Restaurant.

The Easter brunch menu at the Garden Terrace at The Hilton Denver Inverness is pretty thorough. So thorough that it has vanilla bean waffles with Reese’s cookie butter. Seriously, how thorough is that? It also will have face painting, a balloon artist and an egg hunt in the lobby at 11:30 a.m. and 1:30 p.m. $59.95 for adults, $29.95 for kids, kids 5 and under free; 200 Inverness Drive West, Englewood, 303-397-6411

EDGE Restaurant is shaking up its typical prix fixe Easter brunch menu by giving eaters the power to choose how much maple-brushed ham is too much maple-brushed ham via its first-ever Easter brunch buffet. Plus, the Easter Bunny will stop by after his busy morning hiding eggs, and he might even hide some more for the kiddos at EDGE. $85 for adults, $35 for kids; 1111 14th St., Denver, 303-389-3343; edgerestaurantdenver.com; 10 a.m.-3 p.m.

For one day only, Marcella’s Ristorante Pizzeria and Wine Bar will be open for brunch. (Spoiler alert: It’s Easter Sunday.) Choose from Italian-inspired brunch items like shrimp polenta, Nutella waffles and zeppole (Italian doughnuts).  1801 Central St., Denver, 720-484-5484; marcellasrestaurant.com; 11 a.m.-3 p.m.

Bring the kids to Zolo Grill for an Easter egg hunt at 9:30 a.m., followed by balloons and a show from Bongo the Balloon Man at 10:30 a.m. Oh, and there will be food, too.

Finding hidden things is really fun, so why are kids the only ones who get to go hunting? At Bang Up to the Elephant!, grown-ups get an Easter egg hunt of their own, except instead of dumb old eggs, the 21-and-over crowd will scour Capitol Hill (boundaries are Clarkson &amp; Logan streets and 10th &amp; 14th avenues) for colorful Easter coconuts that will be filled with delicious cocktails once you bring them to a Bang Up bartender. Yes, it’s pretty much a neighborhood-wide coconut cocktail hunt. The Caribbean brunch menu isn’t bad, either. 1310 Pearl St., Denver, 303-792-4949; banguptotheelephant.restaurant; 9 a.m.-3 p.m.

CRU will host its annual Napa-style Easter brunch from 10 a.m.-3 p.m. Feast on wine-country classics like Dijon-crusted leg of lamb, goat cheese beignets and crab cake benedict. (We’ll have to take their word for the “wine-country classic” part.) Besides the three-course meal, you’ll get 1/3 off all bottles of wine. $30 for adults, $15 for kids; 1442 Larimer St., Denver, 303-893-9463; cruawinebar.com
