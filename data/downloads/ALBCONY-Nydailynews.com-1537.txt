ALBANY â€” The Democratic son of a former Republican state senator who was one of just four GOPers to vote to legalize gay marriage in New York is considering his own run for a state Senate seat.

Jeremy Saland, 43, is a New York City criminal defense lawyer and a Democratic councilman in the town of New Castle in Westchester County. His father, Stephen Saland, was a longtime state GOP senator who lost his seat in 2012 after voting in favor of the gay marriage bill the previous year.

Saland, who once worked for former Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau, said he's been approached by "numerous people" to run and is "very interested."

The seat is currently held by Republican Terrence Murphy. One other Democrat, Robert Kesten, has publicly expressed interest in running.

Saland was a Republican until 2006, when he said he left the party "as it became too conservative for my liking."

Even though he ran with Democratic support for the New Castle town council, he was not enrolled in the party until officially registering as a Dem in 2017.

"My father's past affiliation is of no consequence," Saland said. "What is relevant is that he taught me to be honest, fair, considerate and hard-working."

He said that was personified by his father's vote for marriage equality.

Before deciding whether to formally throw his hat in the ring, Saland, a married father of three, said he must first work through "a lot of considerations, both personal and professional."

Saland said he has met with Senate Democratic Campaign Committee Chairman Michael Gianaris, of Queens, to discuss the race and vowed that if he runs and is elected, he would sit with the mainline Democrats, not a group of eight breakaway Dems aligned with the GOP.

"There's a period after that statement, not an asterisk," he said.
