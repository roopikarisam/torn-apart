The top Republican lawmaker in the Colorado House, who was behind a failed effort Wednesday to allow people with concealed-carry permits to take guns onto school grounds, attended a meeting Thursday with President Donald Trump on school safety.

House Minority Leader Patrick Neville’s appearance at the White House comes hours after his bill was rejected by Democrats in the Colorado legislature during a long, heated hearing.

The Castle Rock Republican, who survived the 1999 mass shooting at Columbine High School, has brought the legislation several times before. Each time, Democrats have rejected it.

Also set to attend the meeting were Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, Parkland, Fla., Mayor Christine Hunschofsky and Commissioner Rick Sanders of the Kentucky State Police, according to a White House pool report. On Wednesday, Trump met with school shooting survivors and victims’ families — including the father of a girl killed at Columbine — to hear their ideas on preventing violence at schools.

The meetings are in the wake of last week’s high school shooting in Parkland.



“I am tired of just talking about solutions, my bill would have done something to actually protect kids and deter future violence,” Neville said in a statement after his legislation — House Bill 1037 — was rejected Wednesday night. “Proposals to stop gun violence must be realistic to be effective, and it’s so disappointing to watch Democrats bow to their special interest groups and defeat viable options to help protect society.”

Democrats voted down Neville’s legislation on the grounds that more guns do not prevent gun violence.

Neville’s legislation failed , as did two other bills from GOP lawmakers that would have repealed the state’s contentious 2013 ban on high-capacity magazines and allowed business owners and employees to use deadly force against intruders, similar to the “make my day” law for homeowners.


The three bills prompted a protest Wednesday by Democrats and gun-control advocates. Neville vowed to bring his measure again next year.
