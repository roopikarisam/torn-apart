After a major renovation, entertainer extraordinaire and Great American Songbook archivist Michael Feinstein and hubby Terrence Flannery have relisted their legendary 18-room townhouse at 143 E. 63rd St. for $15.9 million.

The elegant 25-foot-wide home features a grand music room with a Steinway overlooking a garden. Elaine Stritch used to rehearse there.

“She had a standing invitation to come any time — and she did,” Feinstein tells Gimme Shelter. One time, she arrived unannounced while Feinstein and Flannery were hosting a dinner party in the garden.

“My guests asked if I had her latest recording. She was giving a live concert performance, serenading our guests, without even realizing it!” Feinstein recalls.

Other guests who have gathered by the piano over the years include Liza Minnelli, Stephen Sondheim and Tony Bennett, to name a few. “When I was in my formative years in California, I’d go to Hollywood parties hosted by Rosemary Clooney, or the Gershwins or Jack Lemmon. Everyone would come and sing and play. We had them here, and I tried to continue the tradition,” Feinstein adds.

He first put the house on the market for $17.9 million in 2013. When it didn’t sell, Feinstein took the advice of his close friends and brokers, Douglas Elliman’s Tom Postilio and Mickey Conlon, then with a different brokerage, and undertook extensive renovations, such as widening rooms and adding a stunning rooftop green space.

“Then we loved the house so much that we didn’t want to leave,” says Feinstein, who has five Grammy Award nominations and Emmy-nominated PBS specials under his belt.

The sale is “bittersweet” for brokers Postilio and Conlon, who were married in the townhouse’s beautiful living room last year. But Feinstein and Flannery are spending more time in Indiana, where Feinstein is artistic director for the Center of the Performing Arts and works as the founder of the Great American Songbook Foundation, which preserves “essential American music” of the 20th century.

“My life is constantly evolving,” Feinstein tells us. “One of the things I love about being a musician is that it can take you down so many different roads. I have been conducting more and spending more time out of New York — in Indiana. and traveling more. I don’t need all the space here.” Feinstein also has two homes in California, including a 50-acre avocado ranch.

He tells us he’ll never leave New York for good. He has Feinstein’s/54 Below in Midtown, plus performances at Jazz at Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall. He will likely buy a smaller pied-a-terre “over time.”

The townhouse for sale is a combo of two brownstones that were built around 1886: one with its current address, which they bought for $3 million in 2004, and 143 E. 63rd St., which they bought for $3.8 million the following year.

One highlight of the now-combined property: There’s a wall-sized Al Hirschfeld mural/theater curtain in the foyer, originally created for Hollywood producer, studio exec and agent Freddie Fields. It’s filled with stars who were Fields’ clients, including Fred Astaire, Barbara Streisand and Woody Allen. Feinstein’s planning to keep that. “It’s pretty spectacular,” he says.

The backyard boasts ivy-covered brick walls and two outdoor pagodas. Inside, there are 12-foot ceilings, grand entertaining spaces, and private quarters with six bedrooms, eight bathrooms and two half bathrooms. There’s also a chef’s kitchen and a second kitchen on the third floor, along with a gym and the newly added “meditation terrace” on the top floor.
