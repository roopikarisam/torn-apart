A former director of a Georgia animal welfare agency was arrested Tuesday.

Andy Sartiano, the former director of the Albany Humane Society, has been charged with aggravated animal cruelty, an Albany Police Department spokeswoman said.

She's accused of ordering an employee to inappropriately euthanize a cat by snapping the pet's neck, according toÂ WALB-TV.

The Albany Humane Society fired Sartiano in August following the allegations.

Sartiano was booked in Dougherty County Jail, and police are still investigating the claims.
