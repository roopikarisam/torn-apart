A man wanted in connection with a carjacking in Stafford County on Monday and other crimes was taken into custody without incident Tuesday afternoon in Prince William County, authorities said.


Robert H. Leegrand III, 25, of Woodbridge, is charged in Stafford with carjacking, using a firearm in the commission of a felony and reckless handling of a firearm. He is being held in the Rappahannock Regional Jail under no bond.


Stafford Sheriff's spokeswoman Amanda Vicinanzo said Leegrand was tracked down Tuesday at an associate's home. Stafford authorities were assisted in the arrest by the FBI Northern Virginia Violent Crimes Task Force, the Fredericksburg Police Department and Virginia State Police.


Stafford deputies went to Barrows Court late Monday morning in response to calls about shots being fired. Witnesses reported that someone in an Audi was shooting at the occupants of a Dodge Dart.


Neither the shooter nor the Dodge occupants were around when deputies arrived, and police began searching for the Audi. Deputies spotted the Audi a little over an hour later in the area of Pine View Court, about six miles from where the shooting had been reported. Authorities have declined to say who the Audi was registered to.


After seeing deputies, the Audi driver drove down a hill at the end of a cul-de-sac, hit a guardrail and jumped out of the vehicle. He then confronted a driver on Interstate 95 at gunpoint, removed the occupants from the car and took off south on the interstate, Vicinanzo said.


The vehicle was found later Monday in the Gateway Village Shopping Center in Fredericksburg, but the suspect apparently had already left the area.


Prince William authorities had been looking for Leegrand since December, when he was accused of violating the conditions of his bond. Leegrand is charged with armed burglary and brandishing a firearm in Prince William and has a trial scheduled in circuit court there on July 31.


He was also wanted in Fairfax County on a grand larceny charge, court records show.
