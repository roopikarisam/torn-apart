A 41-year-old North Bergen man was arrested last week on charges he stabbed a stranger multiple times while threatening to kill him, officials said.

Lester Morales, of the 4200 block of Kennedy Boulevard, is charged with aggravated assault, weapons offenses and making terroristic threats in connection to the indent that occurred on Feb. 9 in North Bergen, the criminal complaint says.

He allegedly stabbed the man "multiple times in the stomach with a sharp object believed to be a knife," the complaint says.

Morales made his first appearance on the charges on Wednesday in Criminal Justice Reform Court in Jersey City via video link from Hudson County jail in Kearny.

At the hearing, he was ordered released with conditions of supervision pending trial.
