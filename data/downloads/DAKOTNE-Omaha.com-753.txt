* * * * *

* There were 58 submissions to be the Durham Museum Christmas tree but only one can be accepted. Which means right now 57 families are going “Bah. Humbug. They don’t know a good tree from their own butts.”

* The Durham goes all out for the holidays. Even the emerald ash borers on the Christmas tree are wearing little Santa caps.

* To determine the age of the Durham tree, all of the rings are counted. It’s the same method used to determine P.J. Morgan’s age.

* The Durham Christmas Tree grew from 3 feet tall to 40 feet tall. The competition to be the official Durham tree is so fierce that now people are using performance enhancers.

* 'Tis the season. Friday morning I saw a group of children making Christmas tree ornaments with oil from the leaking Keystone pipeline.

* Cleanup is underway on a 210,000-gallon Keystone pipeline oil spill in South Dakota. For perspective, that’s almost as much oil as Bob Diaco puts in his hair.

* Friday night, the Omaha Community Playhouse begins a production of “A Christmas Carol.” Scrooge is portrayed by Douglas County Assessor Diane Battiato, who shows up at the Cratchit house on Christmas Eve to inform the family its property taxes are doubling.

* The Nebraska State Patrol pulled over a man dressed as Santa. You know how it goes when our State Patrol pulls over a vehicle. Now the mistletoe Santa was carrying is being tested for hemp.

* A large photo of Scott Frost appeared on The World Herald’s front page Thursday. For those keeping track, I believe the president and governor appeared on pages 3 and 8, respectively.

* I’m pretty sure this was The World-Herald’s biggest-selling issue ever.

* Omaha streetcar proponents claim it will encourage economic development and revitalize the downtown area. Not only that, but it will also end global warming, control world population and grant eternal life.

* A new proposal would reduce the size of the Gene Leahy Mall lagoon and replace it with a big kids’ play area and dog park. My measured response: THIS IS PROBABLY THE WORST IDEA IN THE HISTORY OF MANKIND.

* At minimum, it’s the worst idea since New Coke.

* A lot of fowl call that lagoon home. Let the children of Omaha continue to play where they do now – on the beverage carts at our upscale restaurants.

* Omaha.com has a piece called “20 aerial photos of the Omaha area.” This is interesting: Even from high up in the air you can clearly see our potholes.

* Papillion’s $48 million community center will include water slides, a jogging track, a lazy river, a gym, a playground, soccer fields, a senior center and a library. Oh, and officials just threw in a kitchen sink.

* The International Space Station was not as ambitious as this Papillion community center.

* A lane of Farnam Street is Omaha is restricted for one year. That’s not a misprint. It’s closed for “public improvements.” That sounds like the city is putting in picnic tables and a Bronco’s drive-thru.

* I saw a sign in the Old Market stating there’s a $500 fine and jail sentence of six months for littering. One day maybe Omaha will get that tough with people who rob convenience stores.

* A tech firm called Toast is opening an office in Omaha, potentially creating hundreds of jobs. This may be because Omahans are considered tech-savvy. In celebration, I plan to upgrade to a better flip phone.

* In Mississippi, a small boy raced onto the set of a local TV newscast and appeared to fart on the weather guy. I feel like doing that whenever an Omaha TV weather person delivers the long-range winter forecast.

* The Creighton men’s basketball team upset Northwestern. The World-Herald angle: No telling how – or even if – this will impact Scott Frost’s decision on whether to accept the Husker job.

* The Omaha city review of traffic lights has been completed. That was quick. I’ve spent longer sitting at Omaha red lights.

* OPS enrollment is up 1.2 percent. I’m going to guess fewer students began dropping out the same day the district began offering sex ed.

* An Omaha store has a sale on water pipes. Beat the Christmas rush!

* The Nebraska Brewing Company has come out with a curling-themed beer. Only in Nebraska do we pay tribute to Olympic-caliber athletes with a beer.

* We honor everything with a beer. I almost hope we never get a papal visit.

* On the Japan leg of his trip to Asia, President Trump ordered a hamburger. That’s a little like walking into Fleming’s restaurant and asking for a chili cheese dog.

* Some criticize the awkward way President Trump and Melania hold hands. I will say they look like a couple on the old “Dating Game” that just met after walking around the partition and aren’t thrilled with what they see.

* For the mission to Mars, NASA is searching for crew members who can be compatible for a 34 million mile journey. Don’t look at me. I’m lucky if I get three blocks without arguing with my Lyft driver.

* A Texas woman has the world’s longest fingernails: 18 feet, 10.9 inches. After she gets in her contacts in the morning, it’s all downhill.

* A vote was held to determine the most popular McDonald’s item. This is so important that they borrowed the Electoral College.

* I saw an article called “The Best Place To Travel Based on your Zodiac Sign.” Kearney Archway visitor: “Heck, no, I don’t enjoy it. I’m here because I’m a Taurus.”

* The key to the Huskers defeating Penn State: holding Saquon Barkley to under 400 yards rushing.

* On Thursday, Omaha.com featured a large photo of Scott Frost. I’m pretty sure Mike Riley’s heart skipped a beat when he saw it.

* Reportedly, earlier this season the San Francisco 49ers inquired about trading for Tom Brady. Talk about aiming high. This reminds me of when I was in ninth grade and wrote a letter to movie star Raquel Welch asking her out. The odds are about the same.

* When you look at what’s going on in show business and politics, for the first time professional athletes are pretty much the best behaved people on the planet.

* The Cubs fired their pitching, hitting and third base coaches. There were so many terminations that Clark the Cub is getting nervous.

* The Cubs fired their hitting, pitching and third base coaches. They got bitter after realizing that the Director of Planning World Series Victory Parties, who works about once every 100 years, still had a job.

* College basketball season is getting underway. This is telling: A.D. Bill Moos asked for a seat where he can look over Tim Miles’ shoulder.
