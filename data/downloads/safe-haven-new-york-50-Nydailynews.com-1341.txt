Good deeds really do come back around.

Brennon Jones, who gives free haircuts to the homeless around Philadelphia, has been gifted his own full barber shop.

Jones, 29, created "Haircuts 4 Homeless" in January this year to help men on the street clean themselves up.

"My very first haircut, his name is Braden. I cut his hair on 15th &amp; Walnut (Streets). A few days later, I went to check up on him and he wasn't there. I was hoping nothing bad happened to him. When we did catch up weeks later, he got offered a full-time job," Jones told CBS Philly.

Since that first client, Jones says he's provided over 1,000 free haircuts to men in his community.

Sean Johnson, owner of Taper's Barbershop, saw Jones' work and was inspired. Johnson, who'd purchased a future second location for his own shop, decided to donate the shop to Jones to continue his mission.

Jones said Johnson asked him to stop by the store and asked him if he liked it. "I said yeah I like it, he tossed me the key and said it's yours," Jones recalled to FOX29.

"It wasn't about me giving a barbershop," Johnson said. "When you look at the homeless and the things that they need, I looked at it as more. I built something and I want to see it keep going and I want to see it do a great thing."

Jones plans to open the shop later this month and will dedicate Mondays to serve the homeless, including working with shelters to provide food as well as transportation to and from the shop.

"It's a safe haven for me to touch and bless those lives that often we forget about," Jones said.
