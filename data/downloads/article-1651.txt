Six people were hurt when a livery cab driver hurtled through an intersection near City Hall Thursday, police said.

The driver of a Lincoln Town Car tried to swerve around a for-hire Ford Explorer at Broadway and Liberty St., but hit the SUV instead, cops said.

The Explorer hit a cyclist, crushing the bike under one of the SUV's wheels. The other driver didn't stop.

"There was a big bang and then screams," said Natalia Lozano, an office worker. "He hit the car on Broadway and kept on going. The people were on the ground injured."

The Town Car hit a woman heading uptown in the crosswalk and slammed into a Mercedes. Finally, the cab jumped a curb and hit a parked car.

Hector Freytes, 40, of Astoria, Queens, said he saw a woman dive out of the way in front of him.

"She has the reflexes of a cat," he said. "I hope she's all right."

After the accident, police said the crash was an act of road rage, but late Thursday night, cops backed away from theory and said the Town Car driver suffered a medical episode.

Medics took three people, including one in serious condition, to Bellevue Hospital, while three with minor injuries went to New York-Presbyterian Hospital Lower Manhattan.

The driver of the Town Car was questioned by cops and released.
