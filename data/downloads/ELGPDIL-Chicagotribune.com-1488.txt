Chicago mayoral contender Lori Lightfoot says the killings at a Santa Fe, Texas, high school and other mass shootings shouldn’t obscure the city’s deadly problems with gun violence.


“We’re now talking in the news about the tragic shooting at the school just outside of Houston, which of course is a tragedy. But the reality is, whether it’s in Houston, whether it’s in Parkland or elsewhere, we’re having that kind of body count, that kind of tragedy that destroys individuals and families and communities, on at least a monthly basis if not sooner,” Lightfoot said Sunday on WGN-AM 720.


“It should shock the consciousness of all of us. But now what we see is people feeling the effects of violence creeping into neighborhoods that it wouldn’t necessarily, traditionally creep into. But regardless, this is an issue that affects all of us in Chicago, and we have to dig down deep and compel folks who are responsible for this to have a real meaningful plan,” she said.


Lightfoot, who formerly headed the city’s civilian disciplinary police board, said a “multitiered” approach needs to be made by city leaders that includes beefing up law enforcement as well as economic development in impoverished neighborhoods.


“Even if the Chicago Police Department and our federal partners were operating at full capacity, which I think there’re still many areas in which they should be much more unified … you’ve got to also use your smarts, digging in and having a comprehensive plan to uplift neighborhoods and communities,” she said. “We don’t call that violence reduction, but it has that effect.” (Rick Pearson)


What’s on tap

*Mayor Rahm Emanuel and police Superintendent Eddie Johnson are scheduled to meet with new recruits at the Chicago Police Department Training and Education Academy. Later, Emanuel is set to appear at an event to honor high school students who have earned significant college credit before graduating.


*Gov. Bruce Rauner and first lady Diana Rauner are scheduled to move back into the Executive Mansion.


*The Illinois House and Senate are in session, and a House committee will consider Rauner’s proposal to reinstate the death penalty in Illinois.


*The City Club of Chicago will have a panel about civilian oversight of the Chicago Police Department, featuring Aldermen Ariel Reboyras, Roderick Sawyer and Harry Osterman, as well as Fraternal Order of Police President Kevin Graham.


*The week ahead: On Tuesday, the City Club will host the “Future of the Republican Party in Illinois” panel, including former state party Chairman Pat Brady, former House Republican leader Tom Cross and conservative radio host Dan Proft. On Wednesday, the City Council meets and will consider plans for the Barack Obama Presidential Center.


From the notebook


*Illinois death penalty debate continues Monday: Gov. Rauner’s call for reinstating the death penalty in Illinois for people convicted of killing police officers or more than one person is expected to get a hearing Monday before the state House Judiciary Committee.


Rauner last week included the idea when he rewrote a gun safety measure that called for a 72-hour “cooling-off” period on assault-style weapons and called for extending it to all guns bought in Illinois. The governor also used his amendatory veto power to propose a ban on bump stocks and trigger cranks, among other things.


The governor’s call for reinstituting the death penalty sparked renewed debate over capital punishment, which Illinois abolished in 2011.


Under Rauner’s proposal, the state would create a new homicide category, “death penalty murder,” and guilt would have to be determined “beyond all doubt.”


Lawmakers had the option of accepting or overriding Rauner’s changes. Instead, House Speaker Michael Madigan last week announced Rauner’s rewrite would get full consideration in his chamber. The National Rifle Association has opposed expansion of the waiting period to purchase a gun. Madigan intends for the legislation to be called for a vote before the full House, Democrats said.


*Rezin says she backs Rauner’s crime package but doubts it gets to Senate: State Sen. Sue Rezin, an assistant Senate Republican leader, said she would support Rauner’s anti-crime package that includes a reinstatement of the death penalty and a longer cooling-off period for firearms.


But the lawmaker from Morris said she doubts the bill will get a House vote that could send it to the Senate, despite a vow by Madigan to put the proposal up for a roll call vote.


Rezkin acknowledged the 72-hour waiting period to purchase any firearm is something that isn’t popular in her district.


“I represent a pro-Second Amendment district. This is a challenge for members and constituents in my district,” she said Sunday on WGN-AM 720.


“In totality, there are more good pieces of information in the bill than not, probably something that I would look at supporting,” she said. But she said the bill won’t come to the Senate.


Rauner issued his proposal in rewriting a bill that had created a 72-hour cooling-off period for only military-style firearms, but Rezin said she expects the governor’s changes to be overridden in the House “or the bill will not be voted on and be left to die.” (Rick Pearson)


*Rita sees no casino expansion until sports gambling included: Democratic state Rep. Bob Rita of Blue Island said a key to expanding casino gambling sites in Illinois, including Chicago and the south suburbs, may come by adding sports betting to the mix.

Rita, a House point person on gambling legislation, said a current bill to legalize six new casinos, add gambling at horse race tracks and increase jackpots for video gambling should be considered with legalized sports betting in “one big package.”


Traditionally, various groups with a stake in gambling issues have collided, preventing any expansion bill. But as for sports wagering, he said, “everyone is talking in a positive manner about this.”


“I see a great opportunity in this,” Rita said Sunday on WGN-AM 720.


Asked if it could be accomplished in the closing days of the General Assembly’s scheduled spring session, Rita said “we’re diving into it and see what we can come up with,” despite a host of issues of how sports betting would be regulated and taxed.


“It gives us an opportunity to try to move forward,” Rita said of casino expansion, “something we’ve been talking about and trying to do for a number of years.” (Rick Pearson)


*GOP settles on Rauner’s choice for state chairman: Gov. Rauner’s handpicked leader of the Illinois Republican Party was chosen to serve a second term Saturday, bringing an official close to a behind-the-curtain squabble over the party’s direction between its moderate and conservative members.


Cook County Commissioner Tim Schneider, a longtime Rauner ally, received unanimous support from party leaders to stay on as chairman after brokering a deal with the party’s conservative membership to stave off a contest for his spot. Schneider thanked members for reappointing him, saying while the GOP has its differences “there is much more that brings us together than separates us.”


“As we approach what might be the most critical election in Illinois in our lifetime, we cannot afford to sit this one out and let the Democrats take advantage of our policy differences,” Schneider said.


The display of party unity came just days after Lake County GOP Chairman Mark Shaw, representing the more socially conservative wing, dropped his challenge for Schneider’s post. Shaw gave up that pursuit in exchange for a new title as party co-chairman and leadership over the Republican county chairmen’s association.


“As a party united now, we have a lot of work to do – pulling together to fight, take back our beloved Illinois, and get rid of Mike Madigan and the evil Democrats that infect Chicago, Cook County and the rest of the state,” Shaw said in accepting his new role before receiving a standing ovation.


Shaw’s challenge to Schneider’s leadership threatened to further expose rifts within the Illinois Republican Party as the governor faces a tough re-election bid against Democrat Gold Coast billionaire J.B. Pritzker. Those divisions became highly apparent in the March primary election, when Rauner narrowly won the Republican nomination over his lesser-known challenger, state Rep. Jeanne Ives of Wheaton. Rauner will rely on a unified Republican Party as he seeks a second term. (Bill Lukitsch)
