OAKLAND, Calif. — Know what’s most embarrassing for the Broncos? While this might be a proud franchise’s worst losing streak in 50 years, that was far from the worst of it during a 21-14 loss to the Raiders here Sunday. 

Quarterback Paxton Lynch cried like a baby. Captain Aqib Talib acted like a punk. Coach Vance Joseph griped like a coach who has lost his grip on this team. 

When it was over, after the Broncos had lost for the seventh straight time and players laughed in the locker room about the fight that got Talib ejected, Lynch said the most outrageously stupid thing in this whole embarrassing season.

Denver Broncos offensive coordinator Bill Musgrave and Denver Broncos quarterback Paxton Lynch (12) stand on the sideline stunned as time runs out on Nov. 26, 2017 in Oakland, CA at Oakland-Alameda County Stadium. The Raiders defeated the Broncos 21-14.




“I thought I played pretty well,” said Lynch, flushing what little credibility he has as a starting NFL quarterback. 

Say what? 

Pretty well? Lynch looked like a lost kid in the supermarket, then sat down and cried. He completed only nine passes against the Raiders. For a total of 41 yards. When Lynch tweaked his ankle in the third quarter, he went to the Denver bench and was so inconsolable that everybody in Broncos Country wanted to give him a hug. 

Well, don’t know about anybody else, but I don’t know how it could have possibly gone better for a young quarterback whose third NFL start felt like Lynch’s last chance to prove himself. 

In defeat, the first player out of the Denver locker room, making a beeline for the team bus, was Talib. No surprise there. More than three hours earlier, he deserted his teammates, all because of a feud with Raiders wide receiver Michael Crabtree that Talib won’t let go, any more than he will loosen a grip on the gold chain around the neck of his nemesis. This is a don’t mess with Texas thing, between two guys from Dallas. 


“There’s no way I’m going to be able to control Lib and Crab,” Broncos linebacker Von Miller said. 

Yes, Talib and Crabtree have a history. It’s also true Crabtree began the game in a darker mood than the California skies that poured rain on both teams. In the first quarter, Crabtree took a cheap shot to the gut of Chris Harris,  knocking the wind out of the Denver cornerback, who yelled his objection to the Raiders’ bench as soon as there was enough air in his lungs to protest. 

“He just sucker-punched me,” Harris said. 

On the very next snap, Crabtree flanked out to the right side of Oakland’s formation, staring at Talib across the line of scrimmage. They engaged in a block and wrestled and, as Talib grabbed for the jewelry around Crabtree’s neck, tumbled into the Denver sideline. A melee ensued, and Broncos linebacker Shane Ray jumped in the middle of it, as fists flew. 

“Stuff happens, man,” Ray said. 

Before the refs could break up the fight, Crabtree threw a punch at Talib in the end zone. Both men were ejected from the game, as was Raiders offensive lineman Gabe Jackson, who bumped an official. 

Make any macho excuse you want for Talib, but the truth of the matter is this: In his absence, Raiders quarterback Derek Carr picked on reserve cornerback Brendan Langley. On a touchdown pass. On a pass interference call that led to another Oakland score. And on a third-down completion that ended any hope of a Denver comeback late in the final quarter. 

Talib might be a bad dude in a street fight, but he’s a sorry excuse for a captain. The Broncos needed Talib on the field. He thought proving a macho point was more important than sticking around to help his teammates break the franchise’s longest losing streak since 1967. 

“I don’t like it, and it’s unacceptable,” Joseph said. “We can’t lose our best players because of personal battles. That’s a personal battle. This is about the Broncos, so it’s unacceptable. We can’t have it. It’s nonnegotiable.” 

If it’s truly nonnegotiable, Joseph will discipline Talib. Strip him of his duty as a captain. Suspend him for a game without pay. 

But what are the chances of Joseph actually taking meaningful action against Talib? 

Slim and none. 

Joseph, touted as a leader of men when hired to coach the Broncos, has failed to put his foot down and has been slow to recognize problems before they fester into full-blown football crises. 

With the Broncos in a free-fall, Lynch hiding his shame in a towel and Joseph with no clue how to keep Talib under control, this is more than embarrassing. 

It’s sad, and maybe there’s nothing sadder than the realization Miller is nearing the end of his seventh NFL season, and at this rate, the Broncos might not be playoff contenders again until one of the premier defenders in the league is on the wrong side of age 30. 

“Wasting a prime year,” said Miller. “That’s the frustration.” 

I think this is going pretty well. 

Don’t you?
