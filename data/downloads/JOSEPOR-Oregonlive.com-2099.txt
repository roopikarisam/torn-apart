GRANTS PASS — Oregon State Police say a second person has been arrested in the killing of a man last summer and investigators continue to look for a third suspect.

Sgt. Jeff Proulx says 19-year-old Damian Lee Atwood of Cave Junction was arrested Tuesday and booked into the Josephine County Jail. His arrest comes more than a month after he and other two others were indicted on murder charges.

The body of John Reitterer was found June 22 in a shallow creek along the Illinois River near the southwestern Oregon town of Selma.

Police arrested 22-year-old Ryan Eldred of Coupeville, Washington, shortly after the indictment was handed down in November.

Investigators have identified the final suspect as 22-year-old Elizabeth Hudson of Selma. She's also known as "Little Red."

Those who know her whereabouts are asked to call Oregon State Police at 541-664-4600.
