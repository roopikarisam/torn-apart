Hoboken Mayor Ravi Bhalla has suspended an effort to acquire the Union Dry Dock through eminent domain in hopes that Gov. Phil Murphy will table NJ Transit's dueling plan to purchase the land and turn it into a ferry maintenance facility.

In a statement issued yesterday morning, Bhalla said he is complying with Murphy's request that Hoboken not proceed with obtaining the 3-acre waterfront property through eminent domain, which would see the city condemn the site and mark it for redevelopment.

In return, Bhalla called on Murphy to cancel a special NJ Transit Board of Directors Meeting scheduled for tomorrow, during which the body is expected to vote on whether to purchase the land.

Currently owned by New York Waterway, the parcel is located along Frank Sinatra Drive between Maxwell Place Park and the Castle Point Skate Park. Under NJ Transit ownership, it would be exempt from eminent domain and be leased back to the ferry operator, who would use it as a maintenance facility.

"This decision is in direct response to a proposal Governor Murphy made directly to me last week: suspend or withdraw eminent domain proceedings, and the board meeting will be canceled so we can all get in a room this week and find a way forward," Bhalla said in a statement.

It remains unclear whether tomorrow's 2 p.m. meeting in Newark will proceed. NJ Transit did not return a call seeking comment. A spokesman for the Democratic governor said, meanwhile, Murphy wants to ensure commuters who rely on the ferries don't lose out under either plan.

"The Governor's Office continues to coordinate with all parties involved to determine an ultimate solution that both respects the voices of the local community and the needs of one of our most vital transportation partners," Murphy spokesman Mahen Gunaratna said in a statement.



Hoboken spokesman Santiago Melli-Huber said the city is arranging for buses to transport residents to tomorrow's meeting. The state agency delayed the purchase of the property from NY Waterway in January after Bhalla and 100 residents went to an NJ Transit Board of Directors meeting to oppose the plan.

With sights set on completing a network of parks along the Hoboken waterfront, the City Council last month authorized Bhalla to use eminent domain to acquire the Union Dry Dock site. Bhalla then sent a letter to NY Waterway offering to purchase the property for $11.63 million, adding that if a sale could not be negotiated the city would commence condemnation proceedings and seize the land through eminent domain. Bhalla ended the letter by requesting a response within 14 days.

Yesterday, he extended New York Waterway's 14-day deadline to respond by 45 days.

In a March 31 letter to Bhalla, NJ Transit Executive Director Kevin S. Corbett said the agency's board of directors would hold a special meeting tomorrow and vote to purchase the property from NY Waterway. The ferry operator has a similar maintenance facility on land it leases in Weehawken, but needs a new location after the landowner told the company to "cease such activities" at the site by June 1.

"By purchasing this property, NJ Transit will obtain ownership of the land and gain significant control over the scope and manner of NYWW's operations at the site, while ensuring that the most critical ferry maintenance activities are not significantly disrupted," Corbett wrote in his letter to Bhalla.
