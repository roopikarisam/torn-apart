A 22-year-old woman was arrested in Nevada on Wednesday on an outstanding warrant for murder.

After searching for weeks, police found Elizabeth Devine Hudson, known as Little Red, in Las Vegas and arrested her in connection with the death of 22-year old John Reitterer.

Reitterer, of Crescent City, California, was found dead in a shallow creek off of Illinois River Road, near milepost 6, in the Rogue River-Siskiyou National Forest.

Oregon State Police opened an investigation on June 22, and determined Reitterer's death to be a homicide.

The completed investigation was presented to a Josephine County Grand Jury on Nov. 28. The jury indicted Hudson and two men on the charge of murder and warrants were issued for their arrests.

Ryan Michael Eldred, 22, was arrested that day. Damian Lee Atwood, 19, was arrested Jan. 9. All three suspects were lodged at the Josephine County Jail.
