A Douglas County inmate died Friday in custody. Charles McNeal, 58, convicted of three counts of sexual assault on a juvenile, was confined to hospice care at the time of his death.

The Douglas County Sheriffâ€™s Office has begun an investigation, as required by state law. McNeal died about 12:45 p.m.

A press release from the Douglas County Department of Corrections did not specify where McNeal was when he died, though court records indicate that he was being held at Madonna Rehabilitation Hospital in west Omaha as of Oct. 6. The release said he was hospitalized on Sept. 22 and was later transferred to hospice.

McNeal was scheduled for sentencing on Nov. 17.

Court documents indicate that the assaults were on the same child, who was younger than 12, and took place between Aug. 1, 2012, and Dec. 31, 2014. A jury found McNeal guilty of all three counts on Sept. 7.
