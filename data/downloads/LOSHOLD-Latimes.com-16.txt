Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department homicide detectives are investigating the circumstances surrounding a fire at an East Los Angeles residence where a man was found dead inside.

Firefighters responded to the blaze, which the department described as “suspicious in nature,” in the 600 block of Fetterly Avenue about 9:30 a.m. Friday. Deputies from the Transit Services Bureau had noticed smoke in the neighborhood and called county firefighters for help, authorities said.

The victim, who has not been identified, was described only as an older Latino male. The cause of death has not been determined, according to Los Angeles County coroner records.
