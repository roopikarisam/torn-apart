### Credits

**Torn-Apart** is a in our series of interventions labeled *Mobilized Humanities*. MH brings together digital tools to equip broad social awareness and help in global critical situations. We mobilize humanities faculties, libraries, and students with relevant language, archival, technical and social expertise to nimbly produce curated and applied knowledge. MH sits away from state and non-governmental organizations and is scholarship in an global context.

**Torn-Apart** is a result of intense 6 day collaboration between XPMethod (Manan Ahmed, Alex Gil, Moacir P. de Sá Pereira, Roopika Risam), Borderlands Archives Cartography (Maira E. Álvarez, Sylvia A. Fernández), Linda Rodriguez, and Merisa Martinez.

### Data 

We began with ICE/CBP websites and got the public geo-data that they serve. We then began looking into business records, federal records, news records culling data about locations used by federal, state, and private for-profit agencies. Simultaneously, we were assembling data about "Allies"-- those working to resist or assist or alleviate this crisis. However, our largest data tranche came via our discovery of the ["November 2017 ICE Detention Facility Lists"](https://immigrantjustice.org/staff/blog/ice-released-its-most-comprehensive-immigration-detention-data-yet) which exists because of the FOIA efforts of the Immigrant Legal Resource Center and the National Immigrant Justice Center. Much of our visualizations thus combine these sets of data. We are extremely grateful to ILRC and NIJC for making the ICE data publicly available. Our data will all be available here on git.
