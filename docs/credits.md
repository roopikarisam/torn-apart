*Torn Apart* is part of our *Mobilized Humanities* interventions. *MH* brings together digital tools to equip broad social awareness and help in global critical situations. We mobilize humanities faculties, libraries, and students with relevant language, archival, technical, and social expertise to nimbly produce curated and applied knowledge. *MH* sits away from state and non-governmental organizations and is scholarly activism in a global context.

*Torn Apart* is a result of intense 6-day collaboration between

Sá Pereira, Roopika Risam), [Borderlands Archives
Cartography](https://www.bacartography.org/) (Maira E. Álvarez, Sylvia A. Fernández), Linda Rodriguez, and Merisa Martinez. A special acknowledgment for [Moacir P. de Sá Pereira](http://moacir.com) who hand-cranked the code for everything here.

## Data 

We began with ICE/CBP websites and got the public geo-data that they serve. We then began looking into business records, federal records, and news records culling data about locations used by federal, state, and private for-profit agencies. Simultaneously, we were assembling data about "Allies"-- those working to resist, assist, or alleviate this crisis. However, our largest data tranche came via our discovery of the ["November 2017 ICE Detention Facility Lists"](https://immigrantjustice.org/staff/blog/ice-released-its-most-comprehensive-immigration-detention-data-yet), which exists because of the FOIA efforts of the Immigrant Legal Resource Center and the National Immigrant Justice Center. Our visualizations thus combine these sets of data. We are extremely grateful to ILRC and NIJC for making the ICE data publicly available. Our full sources of data are in the bibliography. Our data is available [here](http://xpmethod.plaintext.in/torn-apart/docs/assets/docs/Torn_Apart_Data_Sheets.xlsx).
