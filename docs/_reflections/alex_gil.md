# Needles Without a North

{: .author-credit }
Prologue by [Alex Gil](http://www.elotroalex.com/). Video interview with Myrna Fuentes and Alex Gil.

[With many thanks to [Gaiutra Bahadur]({{site.baseurl}}/reflections/gaiutra_bahadur.html) for gently nudging me towards my own reflection and the interview with my mother.]

My abuela Lilian rarely got angry, but when she did she froze the room. A saint, we still say, *una santa*. That honor is usually reserved in my family for the very few who are too good. 
 
She was also taciturn. The threads of her story, before I can remember her, never amounted to a dress, not even a rag. I can only patch it together from the other women in her life, and it fails the Bechdel test: She had a Dutch father. She came to New York pregnant with my mom in 1952, escaping the Trujillo regime, not long after his goons murdered her first cousin. She married a Boricua named Fuentes.  She never told my mom, Myrna Fuentes, that the man my mother knew as her father, the first Fuentes, was not her father. She showed up at the bigamous Fuentes' house with a baseball bat—before Beyoncé made it a thing. She married the Cuban Fuentes, another disappointing grandson of some fountain in Europe; She learned to sew for a living in New York. That living was hers—mechanical needles pointing to the ground.
 
No surprise that stories of abuela, and who we are by her side, can follow different patterns, depending on the teller. I prefer the almost symmetrical return to her for my mother and I—a personal source of wonder. I usually start with my mother growing up on 110th between Broadway and Amsterdam, in her apartment, barely a few blocks from Columbia University, where I work now. My mom left her and New York City for the Dominican Republic when she finished high school. That's where I was born and raised. She did not use her *jus sanguinis* rights, and my brother and I were born Dominican citizens... because we were boys. If she had girls, she says, no problem, but she wasn't about to let her boys grow up to die in an American war. 

My grandmother moved back to Dominican Republic when we were kids. She had a beautiful house in Naco, where the rich people lived. I remember her there first. I was her favorite, we still say. She returned to the United States, after the second Fuentes had an idiotic red scare when Antonio Guzman rose to power. She returned to the Dominican Republic—again—when I was a teenager in the 80s, to move close to us. That didn't last either, and her needle eventually settled in Miami.

When I graduated high school, my mom gave me the option to become a US citizen, right before I'd lose my chance forever on my 18th birthday. I chose it and moved to Miami to live with my abuela. Her small house in Cutler Ridge was full of mirrors and pictures of me. Everyone else had to settle for a cameo. I lived there for many years, learning the United States, but not much about her—greedily receiving the love given to the favorite, and cautiously avoiding the secrets beyond. She passed without proper goodbyes. Many cities later, I ended up where my mom played as a kid, running around Butler Library, while my abuela sewed nearby. My needle spins less to the North, than it does to them—still, a mi abuela, a mi mama; and now, a mi gringa latina, la Laurell, and my two mijos, Emil and el Henry, mi familia, mis amigXs and our torn apart strangers. The North is... just an accident.
 
When we started doing Torn Apart/Separados, I kept returning to abuela and her enigmas: The visas, her green card, the early life as an immigrant in New York, when it was harder to leave the Dominican Republic than to enter the United States, her many returns. The North American imagination I have come to know so well only sees needles pointing North—dangerous, narcissistic fantasies of barbarians at the southern gates. Expecting better of needles, I asked mi mama to sit down with me and help me add a few stitches to abuela's story. I am glad I can share this bit of recorded oral history with you in TA/S Volume 2—where we paint the wedges that tear us apart and uncover the greed of their cold hammers. Against the mechanics of incarceration and separation, we offer you our needles without a North.
