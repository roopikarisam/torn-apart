Florence Nightingale had a mission. It was essential to persuade the British
Army, over the protestations of its generals who were convinced they knew
better than some woman, that terrible hygiene was killing off their troops
faster than enemy bullets. Half a year after her arrival at the Scutari
Barracks, now the Selimiye Barracks in the Üsküdar district of Istanbul, the
mortality rate of British soldiers dropped from 42.7% to 2.2%.[^cohen] She was certain
it was the introduction of sanitation measures that cause the decrease, but
how could she show it to drive home the difference her efforts made?

For Nightingale, familiar with the pioneering statistical work of Adolphe
Quetelet and William Farr, aggregating data about individual outcomes to draw
a larger picture seemed the best way to make a convincing argument, reversing
the adage about tragedy and statistics typically misattributed to Stalin.
Instead of flattening each individual’s tragedy in dying from poor sanitation,
Nightingale compounded the tragedies into one greater than the sum of its
parts, an emergent entity that carried extra affective weight from its simple
proposals: more medical supplies, more nurses, less filth.

But as Nightingale explains in the opening of 1858 pamphlet on the mortality of the
British Army, a diagram will be more useful to carry this affective weight,
prompting the design of the “batwings,” diagrams that treated the year as a
cycle and drew a line around the calendar to show trends in mortality.

<h2>Diagrams <small>representing the relative Mortality from <span class="purple">ZYMOTIC
DISEASES</span>, from <span class="green">WOUNDS</span>, and from <span
class="orange">ALL OTHER CAUSES</span> in the HOSPITALS of the ARMY in the
EAST</small></h2>

Despite the fact that for some reason the years go from right to left
(reproduced from Nightingale’s original) and that the visualizations begin on
April 1, or what is 9 o’clock on the calendar wheels, these diagrams
demonstrate *very* clearly that the bulk of soldiers were dying of infection,
or “zymotic diseases.” Wounds and other causes are barely a blip in the chart.
Yet Nightingale engages in a bit of sleight of hand to make the salient
political point here.  During the time period covered in these diagrams,
14,476 soldiers died from zymotic diseases, as opposed to 3,486 of wounds and
other causes. In other words, about four times as many soldiers died of
zymotic diseases.

Does the purple batwing look four times larger than the other two batwings
combined? 

With an *n* of one (my mom), the answer is clearly no. Nightingale is not
wrong to suggest that too many soldiers are dying of infectious disease. But
this chart makes it look like soldiers are *only* dying of infectious disease,
with a negligible number dying from causes more proximate to war. To achieve
this effect, Nightingale mobilizes two “tricks” of the visualization trade,
using two dimensions to represent a one-dimensional variable, and then using a
rate to
