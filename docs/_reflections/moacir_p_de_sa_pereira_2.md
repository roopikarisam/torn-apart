# Mapping Maybe

> Diagrams are of great utility for illustrating certain questions of vital
statistics by conveying ideas on the subject through the eye, which cannot be
so readily grasped when contained in figures.[^nightingale]

> Not only is it easy to lie with maps, it’s essential.[^monmonier]

Florence Nightingale had a mission. It was essential to persuade the British
Army, over the protestations of its generals who were convinced they knew
better than some woman, that terrible hygiene was killing off their troops
faster than enemy bullets.

[^yerba-buena]: On zits, consider the unsettled persona looking to stop her own genre flailing through what Urayoán Noel calls Sandra Maria Esteves’s “organic poetics”: “[I got up this morning to brush my teeth](http://www.sandraesteves.com/images/480_Yerba_Buena_p31.jpg) / and found seven new pimples on my face / The first pimple was green / had a picture of george washington / smiled at me a long time saying it was my friend / but when I squeezed it / it was full of war and blood.” Noel, _In Visible Movement: Nuyorican Poetry from the Sixties to Slam_ (Iowa City, University of Iowa Press: 2014), 75–82 and Esteves, “Staring into the eye of truth,” in _Yerba buena: dibujos y poemas_ (Greenfield Center, NY: Greenfield Review, 1980), 44.  Note especially how crisis and the various modes of flailing themselves reproduce themselves in the persona’s body, on her face, while she looks below, to the humus, to ground and stop the flailing. For grounding in terms of geographical visualization, see LaDona Knigge and Meghan Cope, “Grounded Visualization: Integrating the Analysis of Qualitative and Quantitative Data through Grounded Theory and Visualization,” _Environment and Planning A_ 31.11 (2006), 2021–2037 [http://dx.doi.org/10.1068/a37327](http://dx.doi.org/10.1068/a37327).

[^fuck]: Haraway’s Eye “fucks the world to make techno-monsters,” of course, but I prefer, optimistically, to think of ourselves as just [getting screwed](https://youtu.be/fgSpeV-bklk). But that’s for a different now.
