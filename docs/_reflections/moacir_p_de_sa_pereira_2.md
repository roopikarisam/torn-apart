# Mapping Maybe

> Diagrams are of great utility for illustrating certain questions of vital
statistics by conveying ideas on the subject through the eye, which cannot be
so readily grasped when contained in figures.[^nightingale]

> Not only is it easy to lie with maps, it’s essential.[^monmonier]

Florence Nightingale had a mission. It was essential to persuade the British
Army, over the protestations of its generals who were convinced they knew
better than some woman, that terrible hygiene was killing off their troops
faster than enemy bullets. Half a year after her arrival at the Scutari
Barracks, now the Selimiye Barracks in the Üsküdar district of Istanbul, the
mortality rate of British soldiers dropped from 42.7% to 2.2%.[^cohen] She was certain
it was the introduction of sanitation measures that cause the decrease, but
how could she show it to drive home the difference her efforts made?

For Nightingale, familiar with the pioneering statistical work of Adolphe
Quetelet and William Farr, aggregating data about individual outcomes to draw
a larger picture seemed the best way to make a convincing argument, reversing
the adage about tragedy and statistics typically misattributed to Stalin.
Instead of flattening each individual’s tragedy in dying from poor sanitation,
Nightingale compounded the tragedies into one greater than the sum of its
parts, an emergent entity that carried extra affective weight from its simple
proposals: more medical supplies, more nurses, less filth.

But as Nightingale explains in the opening of 1858 pamphlet on the mortality of the
British Army, a diagram will be more useful to carry this affective weight,
prompting the design of the “batwings,” diagrams that treated the year as a
cycle and drew a line around the calendar to show trends in mortality.
