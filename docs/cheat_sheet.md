Descriptive Data

Column A: Unique identifier for awards
[we are totally safe “counting” contracts by column A’s unique identifiers]

Column B: Modification numbers documenting changes to initial award
[only latest modifications are in “no dupes” file as they represent the latest changes to the awards]

Column C: Transaction number
[irrelevant to our data because there aren’t multiple transactions or multiple contracts under the same award number. Apparently this is typical of 94.83% of gov’t contracts according to data related to the Recovery Act Recipient Reporting]

Column D: Parent Award Agency ID
[if the award came through a parent contract - or “parent award” - this is the ID number of the agency that awarded it. A lot of these awards *do* come through parent contracts, which means these companies most likely have their hands in a lot of different gov’t pies - our unique awards/amounts here are just the ICE part]

Column E: Parent Award Agency Name
[Name of agency where parent award came from. Some of the agencies have multiple agency IDs - e.g. Federal Acquisition Service appears variously as 4730 and 4732 in Column D. This is because they correspond to sub-codes in the Federal Procurement Data System based on type of acquisition.]

Column F: Parent award numbers for procurement related to Federal Supply Schedules
[Unique identifiers in Column A may share “parent award numbers” but are still unique awards granted by ICE via Department of Homeland Security]

Column G: Parent award modification number
[indicates if the award is the result of a modification to the parent award]

The Money Data

Gov’t regulations require recording of all contract changes. Negative, very small, and zero amounts are changes made to existing contracts. Negative amounts reflect the de-obligation of the gov’t. The very small/zero amounts reflect a very minimal change in the original contract.

Column H: Federal action obligation
[gov’t obligation, de-obligation or liability for contract]

Column I: Base amount and exercised options
[amount of all  exercised line items in contract at effective date or modification date]

***Column J: Current total value of award
[total amount of $ obliged by the gov’t to date (as of July 4, 2018 when we pulled this data) including base and exercised options. This obligation is legally binding.  

this is, to RR’s mind, the best financial data to use because this is how much we know the gov’t has committed for sure, it also reflects *net* value taking into account contract modifications to-date]

Column K: Base and all options value
[ultimate value of contract or modification]

Column L: Potential total value of award

[the amount the gov’t could end up dishing out if all options on the contracts are exercised. The gov’t *could* be obligated to this amount legally.

super interesting because it shows potential but RR thinks it risks distorting the picture. In FY 13-16, the current total value was consistently less than the potential value but not too far off. But in FY 17-18, there’s huge divergence. It might appear like a readiness to fund ICE to the hilt, and maybe that’s the case, but RR’s not convinced we need to risk the credibility of what we’re doing on the alarmist worst case scenario - but open to other opinions of course]

Temporal Data

Column M: Action Date
[date binding agreement was reached]

Column N: Period of performance start date
[date on which award is effective]

Column O: Period of performance current end date
[expected end date of contract]

Column P: Period of performance potential end date
[potential end date of contract if all options on contract are exercised]

Column Q: Ordering period end date
[date after which no more orders on contract can be placed; only refers to indefinite delivery contracts or blanket purchase agreements]

Agency Data
Column R: Awarding agency code
[code for agency granting award - these awards are all granted by Department of Homeland Security]
Column S: Awarding agency name
[name of awarding agency - all granted by DHS]

Column T: Awarding subagency code

Column U: Awarding subagency name
[name of awarding subagency - all granted by ICE]

Column V: Awarding office code
[code for office within subagency granting award]
